    </div>

    <p class="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-6">
      You shipped. You posted on Twitter. You watched the likes roll in — 40, maybe 80 if you caught a good algorithm day. Then you refreshed your Stripe dashboard and saw: <strong class="text-white">$0</strong>. Two days later the post is buried and nobody's talking about it.
    </p>

    <p class="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-6">
      This is the standard developer launch. It fails not because your product is bad, and not because your audience is too small. It fails because a one-shot announcement is structurally broken as a sales mechanism.
    </p>

    <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-white mb-4 mt-10">The One-Shot Announcement Problem</h3>

    <p class="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-6">
      Consumer psychology is well-studied here: people need between <strong class="text-white">5 and 12 touchpoints</strong> before they're ready to buy. A single tweet or Product Hunt post delivers one touchpoint. You're asking someone to go from "I've never heard of this" to "here's my credit card" in a single interaction. Most people aren't ready.

Your ideal customer is deep in a debugging session, skims the tweet, and thinks "interesting, I'll check it out later." Later never comes. They didn't buy — but they also didn't say no. They just forgot.</p>

    <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-white mb-4 mt-10">How an Email Sequence Changes the Math</h3>

    <p class="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-6">
      An email sequence solves every one of these problems systematically. Instead of one announcement, you send seven emails over ten days. Each email does a specific job: building curiosity, establishing pain, telling your story, showing the product, making the offer, handling objections, and creating urgency to close.
    </p>

    <p class="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-6">
      You're not announcing — you're <strong class="text-white">nurturing</strong>. You're giving people the time and context they need to go from "interested stranger" to "paying customer" at their own pace, but within a defined window.
    </p>

    <div class="bg-navy-light border border-white/10 rounded-xl p-6 mb-6">
      <p class="text-sm font-semibold text-coral mb-3">The Developer Analogy</p>
      <p class="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
        A one-shot launch is like calling an API once and giving up if it returns a 202 Accepted instead of immediate data. An email sequence is like implementing proper polling — you check back at the right intervals, handle the state transitions, and close the loop when the job is done. You're not being pushy; you're being <code class="text-coral bg-coral/10 px-1.5 py-0.5 rounded font-mono text-sm">eventually consistent</code>.
      </p>
    </div>

    <p class="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
      The sequence below is designed for a list of any size. 50 subscribers or 5,000 — the logic works the same. Let's build it email by email.

        If you have under 300 subscribers, skip most segmentation. You don't have enough data for it to be meaningful. Just send to your whole list and focus on writing good emails. Segmentation is a scale problem — solve it when it becomes one.

      <p class="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed text-sm mb-3">
        If your list is small, don't spend time setting up automation — spend that time making the emails better. Schedule each email in your calendar, write it fresh each day using the templates above, and hit send. Small lists actually benefit from this: your emails will feel more personal, you can react to replies in real time, and you'll learn things about your audience that no automation reveals.
      </p>
      <p class="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed text-sm">
        The threshold where automation saves more time than it costs to set up is around 200-300 subscribers. Below that, the cost of setup and testing exceeds the time saved.
