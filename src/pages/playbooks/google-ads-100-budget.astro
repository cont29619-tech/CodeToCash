    </div>

    <p class="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-6">
      Before you hand Google a credit card, answer an honest question: does anyone search for what you've built? Google Ads is a demand-capture channel. It intercepts people who already know they have a problem and are actively looking for a solution. If nobody is typing queries related to your product category, you'll burn $100 and have nothing to show for it.
    </p>

    <p class="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-6">
      That's the fundamental difference between Google Ads and social ads. Facebook and Twitter create demand — you interrupt people and make them want something they weren't thinking about. Google captures demand that already exists. Both have their place, but they work completely differently. This playbook is about the latter.

    <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-white mb-4 mt-10">The Mindset Shift: $100 is a Learning Budget</h3>

    <p class="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-6">
      This is the most important reframe in this entire playbook. Your first $100 on Google Ads is not a growth investment. It's market research you pay for. You are buying data: which keywords attract buyers, which ad copy gets clicks, what your actual conversion rate is when someone arrives with purchase intent. That data is worth far more than $100 if you use it correctly.
    </p>

    <div class="bg-navy-light border border-white/10 rounded-xl p-6 mb-6">
      <p class="text-sm font-semibold text-coral mb-3">Developer Analogy</p>
      <p class="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
        Think of $100 in ads like running a load test on your funnel. You're not trying to handle 100,000 requests — you're stress-testing the system with controlled traffic to find where it breaks. The test itself is the value, not the traffic. <code class="text-coral bg-coral/10 px-1.5 py-0.5 rounded font-mono text-sm">runLoadTest(budget: 100)</code> returns <code class="text-coral bg-coral/10 px-1.5 py-0.5 rounded font-mono text-sm">BottleneckReport</code>, not revenue.
      </p>
    </div>

    <p class="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
      Go in expecting to learn, not to profit. If you happen to get signups or sales along the way, great. But the real output is a validated keyword list, a winning ad variant, and a measured conversion rate. Those are the building blocks of a scalable paid channel.

    <p class="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">
      Google offers several campaign types. For a developer product on a $100 test budget, only one is right:
    </p>

          <p class="text-gray-400 text-sm leading-relaxed">Text ads shown when someone types a specific query. High intent. You only pay when someone clicks. You control which keywords trigger your ad. This is the only campaign type where you can precisely target people actively looking for your solution.</p>

      </div>
      <div class="flex items-start gap-4 p-4 rounded-xl bg-white/[0.03] border border-white/5">

        <div>
          <p class="font-semibold text-white mb-1">Display Campaigns — skip for now</p>
          <p class="text-gray-400 text-sm leading-relaxed">Banner ads shown across millions of websites. Low intent — people aren't searching for anything. CPCs are cheap but click quality is terrible. Useful for retargeting later, not for your first $100.</p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="flex items-start gap-4 p-4 rounded-xl bg-white/[0.03] border border-white/5">
        <span class="flex items-center justify-center w-8 h-8 rounded-lg bg-red-500/10 text-red-400 font-mono font-bold text-xs shrink-0">✕</span>
        <div>
          <p class="font-semibold text-white mb-1">Performance Max — absolutely skip this</p>
          <p class="text-gray-400 text-sm leading-relaxed">Google's fully automated campaign type that runs across all their channels simultaneously. Sounds convenient, but you have almost no control over where your ads appear, who sees them, or what keywords trigger them. Google optimizes for conversions — but if you have no conversion data yet, it's essentially random. Small budgets get wasted fast.</p>
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>

    <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-white mb-4 mt-10">Budget: $5/Day and Why to Start Small</h3>

    <p class="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-6">
      Set your daily budget to $5. Not $20, not $50 — $5. Here's why: Google's algorithm needs time to learn which clicks lead to conversions. During the learning phase (the first 1–2 weeks), performance is unpredictable and often worse than it will eventually be. Spending $50/day during the learning phase burns money before you have enough data to make good decisions. At $5/day, your $100 lasts 20 days — long enough to gather meaningful data and make optimization decisions.

        <p class="text-gray-400 text-sm">These four English-speaking markets have the highest developer density and purchasing power. Unless your product is region-specific, start here.

    </div>

    <p class="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-6">
      Keywords are where most first-time advertisers waste their money. They target keywords that have high volume but low commercial intent — people researching, not buying. The goal here isn't to get the most clicks. It's to get clicks from people who are ready to pay for a solution.
    </p>

    <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-white mb-4 mt-10">Commercial Intent vs. Informational Intent</h3>

    <p class="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">
      Every search query falls on a spectrum from pure research to purchase-ready. For a $100 test budget, only bid on keywords at the commercial end of that spectrum.
    </p>

    <div class="p-5 bg-[#0d0d20] border border-white/10 rounded-xl font-mono text-sm mb-8">
      <p class="text-gray-500 mb-3">// Intent signals in keywords</p>

      </div>
    </div>

    <p class="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-6">
      Commercial intent keywords often include words like: <span class="text-white font-medium">software, tool, service, platform, solution, pricing, plans, free trial, alternative to [competitor]</span>. Informational intent keywords often include: <span class="text-white font-medium">how to, what is, tutorial, guide, learn, free</span>. Informational keywords may eventually be worth targeting, but not with a $100 test budget.

    <p class="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">
      Keyword Planner is free inside Google Ads. Use it to validate search volume and estimated CPCs before you commit to keywords. Here's the workflow:

        <span class="text-coral font-mono text-xs mt-0.5">02</span>
        <p>Enter 3–5 seed terms that describe what your product does — not the brand name, the <em>category</em>. E.g. for an uptime monitoring tool: "uptime monitoring," "website monitoring service," "server monitoring software"</p>
      </div>
      <div class="flex items-start gap-3 text-gray-300 text-sm leading-relaxed">
        <span class="text-coral font-mono text-xs mt-0.5">03</span>

        <span class="text-coral font-mono text-xs mt-0.5">04</span>
        <p>Sort by <strong class="text-white">Average monthly searches</strong>. Look for keywords with 100–10,000 searches/month. Under 100 means tiny audience; over 10,000 usually means too broad and expensive.</p>

      <div class="flex items-start gap-3 text-gray-300 text-sm leading-relaxed">
        <span class="text-coral font-mono text-xs mt-0.5">05</span>
        <p>Check the <strong class="text-white">Top of page bid (high range)</strong> column. This is what you'd need to pay to appear in position 1–3. If bids are above $15–$20, be cautious — your $100 disappears in 5–10 clicks.</p>

        <span class="text-coral font-mono text-xs mt-0.5">06</span>

    <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-white mb-4 mt-10">Match Types Explained</h3>

    <p class="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">
      Match types control how closely a search query must match your keyword before your ad shows. Choosing the wrong match type is one of the most common ways to waste money.
    </p>

    <div class="space-y-4 mb-8">
      <div class="p-4 bg-[#0d0d20] border border-white/10 rounded-xl">
        <p class="font-mono text-sm text-coral mb-2">Broad Match — keyword</p>
        <p class="text-gray-400 text-sm leading-relaxed mb-2">Shows your ad for any query Google thinks is related to your keyword. This includes synonyms, related topics, and wildly off-topic searches. "uptime monitoring" in broad match could trigger for "how do I check if my site is down" — informational, no buying intent.</p>
        <p class="text-yellow-400 text-xs font-mono">Verdict: Avoid on a small budget. Too broad, too expensive.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="p-4 bg-[#0d0d20] border border-white/10 rounded-xl">
        <p class="font-mono text-sm text-coral mb-2">Phrase Match — "keyword"</p>
        <p class="text-gray-400 text-sm leading-relaxed mb-2">Shows your ad when the query contains your keyword phrase (in any order, with other words around it). "uptime monitoring" in phrase match catches "affordable uptime monitoring service" and "uptime monitoring for small business" — still relevant. Gives you control with some flexibility.</p>
        <p class="text-green-400 text-xs font-mono">Verdict: Your primary match type for this $100 test.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="p-4 bg-[#0d0d20] border border-white/10 rounded-xl">
        <p class="font-mono text-sm text-coral mb-2">Exact Match — [keyword]</p>
        <p class="text-gray-400 text-sm leading-relaxed mb-2">Shows your ad only for queries that match your keyword extremely closely. [uptime monitoring] catches "uptime monitoring" and very close variants like "uptime monitor." Very precise, very controlled, lower volume.</p>
        <p class="text-green-400 text-xs font-mono">Verdict: Use for your highest-value, highest-intent keywords alongside phrase match.</p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-white mb-4 mt-10">Negative Keywords: The Most Underrated Setting</h3>

    <p class="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-6">
      Negative keywords prevent your ad from showing for irrelevant queries. They are arguably more important than your positive keyword list, especially with a tight budget. Every click from an irrelevant query is money you can't get back.
    </p>

    <p class="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">
      Add these as negative keywords before you launch. They prevent your ad from showing to people in pure research mode:
    </p>

    <div class="p-5 bg-[#0d0d20] border border-white/10 rounded-xl font-mono text-sm mb-8">
      <p class="text-gray-500 mb-3">// Negative keywords to add immediately</p>
      <p class="text-red-400 mb-1">"free" (unless you have a free tier)</p>
      <p class="text-red-400 mb-1">"open source"</p>

      <p class="text-red-400 mb-1">"github"</p>
      <p class="text-red-400">"reddit"</p>
    </div>

    <p class="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-6">
      After your campaign runs for a few days, check the <strong class="text-white">Search Terms report</strong> (Keywords → Search Terms). This shows you the actual queries that triggered your ads. Scan it daily during your $100 test and add any irrelevant terms as negatives. This is the single highest-leverage optimization you can make.

      Your ad is the only thing standing between a searcher and your landing page. It has to earn the click in about 2 seconds — competing against 3–5 other ads at the top of the results page. Bad ad copy gets ignored. Good ad copy not only gets clicks but pre-qualifies visitors so the people who arrive are likely to convert.

    <p class="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-6">
      You can write perfect ad copy and select perfect keywords, and still lose money — if your landing page doesn't deliver on the promise your ad made. The click is a moment of intent. The landing page is where you either fulfill or break that intent. Mismatches between ad and page are the #1 conversion killer in paid search.
    </p>

    <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-white mb-4 mt-10">Message Match: Headline to Headline</h3>

    <p class="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">
      The most direct form of message match: your ad headline and your landing page headline should reinforce the same core promise. They don't need to be identical — but the visitor should feel a continuous thread of meaning from the ad to the page.
    </p>

    <div class="p-5 bg-[#0d0d20] border border-white/10 rounded-xl font-mono text-sm mb-6">
      <p class="text-gray-500 mb-3">// Message match examples</p>

    </div>

    <p class="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-6">
      If your ad targets the keyword "saas authentication api" and your landing page opens with "Everything You Need to Build Great Products" — that's a mismatch. The visitor clicked for authentication specifically. They're not going to hunt your page to find out if it applies to them. They'll bounce in 3 seconds.
    </p>

    <p class="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-6">
      For high-value keyword groups, consider creating dedicated landing pages that mirror the ad's exact message. A "saas boilerplate" ad pointing to a /saas-boilerplate landing page with a headline about SaaS boilerplates will dramatically outperform the same ad pointing to your generic homepage.

    <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-white mb-4 mt-10">Quality Score Explained</h3>

    <p class="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">
      Quality Score is Google's 1–10 rating of the relevance and quality of your keyword, ad, and landing page combination. It directly affects two things: how often your ad shows (Ad Rank) and how much you pay per click. A higher Quality Score means lower CPCs for the same position.

      <p class="text-gray-300 mb-3">Your Ad Rank: 4.00 × 8 = <span class="text-green-400">32</span></p>
      <p class="text-green-400">You rank higher and pay less per click.</p>
    </div>

    <p class="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">
      Quality Score has three components: <strong class="text-white">Expected Click-Through Rate</strong> (does your ad get clicked for this keyword?), <strong class="text-white">Ad Relevance</strong> (does your ad match the search intent?), and <strong class="text-white">Landing Page Experience</strong> (is your landing page relevant, fast, and easy to navigate?).

        Include your target keyword in your ad headline AND in your landing page headline. This single change raises Ad Relevance and Landing Page Experience simultaneously — the two factors that most drag Quality Score down for new campaigns.

    <p class="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
      If someone searches "uptime monitoring software," your ad headline should include "Uptime Monitoring Software" and your landing page H1 should include the same phrase. This creates the relevance signal Google needs to see across all three Quality Score components. You'll pay less, rank higher, and convert more — all from one focused change.

      Running ads without conversion tracking is the equivalent of deploying code with no logging. You're flying blind. You might be getting signups — or burning money on visitors who bounce immediately. You genuinely cannot tell without tracking set up. This section covers what to measure and how to use the data.
