      <h2 class="text-2xl md:text-3xl font-bold">The Pricing Mistake Every Developer Makes</h2>
    </div>

    <p class="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-6">
      You've built something. Now you need to put a number on it. So you do one of two things: you calculate how many hours it took and multiply by your hourly rate, or you look at what similar tools charge and pick something in the same range. Both feel logical. Both are wrong.
    </p>

    <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-white mb-4">Mistake 1: Pricing on Cost or Time</h3>

    <p class="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">
      "I spent 400 hours on this, so at $50/hour that's $20,000 worth of work — I'll charge $97." This is called cost-plus pricing, and it's how you build a product and fail to sell it. Your cost is irrelevant to your customer. They don't care how long it took you to build. They care about one thing: what it does for them.
    </p>

    <p class="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-6">
      Cost-plus pricing also systematically undercharges. A tool that saves an engineer 5 hours a week is worth <em>thousands of dollars per year</em> to a company — regardless of whether it took you a weekend or three months to build. If you price it at $29/month because "that seems fair for my effort," you're leaving most of that value on the table.
    </p>

    <div class="p-5 bg-[#0d0d20] border border-white/10 rounded-xl font-mono text-sm mb-8">
      <p class="text-gray-500 mb-3">// The cost-plus pricing trap</p>
      <p class="text-red-400 mb-1">cost_of_building = 400h × $50/hr = $20,000</p>
      <p class="text-red-400 mb-3">price = $97  <span class="text-gray-500">// "seems fair"</span></p>
      <p class="text-gray-500 mb-1">// What you should ask instead:</p>
      <p class="text-green-400 mb-1">value_to_customer = 5h/week × 50 weeks × $80/hr = $20,000/yr</p>
      <p class="text-green-400">price = ???  <span class="text-gray-500">// suddenly $97/yr looks very low</span></p>
    </div>

    <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-white mb-4">Mistake 2: Copying Competitors Without Understanding Why</h3>

    <p class="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">
      Looking at what competitors charge is useful data — but treating it as a constraint is dangerous. Competitors made their pricing decisions with their own cost structure, their own customer acquisition model, their own growth stage, and their own mistakes baked in. Copying them means inheriting all of that, blindly.
    </p>

    <p class="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-6">
      More importantly: if you price identically to an established competitor, you're signalling to the market that you're the same product. You're not. Use competitor pricing as a reference point, not a ceiling.
    </p>

        <div>
          <p class="font-semibold text-white mb-1">Competitive pricing is a starting point, not an answer</p>
          <p class="text-gray-400 text-sm leading-relaxed">Use competitor prices to understand market expectations and what customers are already comfortable paying. Then ask: what makes my product worth more? Or: why would someone pay less for mine? Position and price accordingly.</p>
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>

    <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-white mb-4">The Correct Framework: Price on Value Delivered</h3>

    <p class="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">
      Value-based pricing starts with a single question: <strong class="text-white">what is it worth to the customer for this problem to be solved?</strong> The answer comes in three forms:
    </p>

    <div class="space-y-4 mb-8">
      <div class="flex items-start gap-4 p-4 rounded-xl bg-white/[0.03] border border-white/5">

        <div>
          <p class="font-semibold text-white mb-1">Time saved</p>
          <p class="text-gray-400 text-sm leading-relaxed">If your tool saves a developer 3 hours a week, that's 150 hours a year. At a $60/hr effective rate, that's $9,000 in recovered time. Your tool is worth a substantial fraction of that — conservatively 10-20%, or $900-$1,800/year. If you're charging $19/month ($228/year), you're pricing at 2.5% of the value you deliver.</p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="flex items-start gap-4 p-4 rounded-xl bg-white/[0.03] border border-white/5">

          <p class="font-semibold text-white mb-1">Revenue generated</p>
          <p class="text-gray-400 text-sm leading-relaxed">If your landing page template helps a developer's SaaS convert 2x better, and that SaaS earns $5,000/month, your template directly contributed to thousands of dollars in additional revenue. Charge accordingly. $197 or $297 is trivial compared to the outcome.</p>

          <p class="text-gray-400 text-sm leading-relaxed">Some pain is so frustrating that people pay just to never deal with it again — even if the time cost is hard to quantify. Authentication, billing, deployment, error monitoring: developers will pay a premium to have these things "just work." The emotional value of removing friction is real and should be priced into your product.</p>

      <h2 class="text-2xl md:text-3xl font-bold">The Four Pricing Models for Dev Products</h2>
    </div>

    <p class="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-8">
      Pricing model and price point are two separate decisions. The model determines <em>how</em> customers pay — one time, recurring, or metered. Get the model wrong and no price point will save you. Here are the four models used by successful indie dev products, with clear guidance on when each one fits.
    </p>

    <!-- Model 1: One-Time Purchase -->
    <div class="mb-12 p-6 bg-navy-light border border-white/10 rounded-2xl">

      </div>
      <p class="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed text-sm mb-5">
        The customer pays once and owns the product forever. Simple, clean, no retention pressure. Best suited to products that deliver a discrete, self-contained value: a template, a script, a code generator, a boilerplate, or a lifetime deal on a tool that requires minimal ongoing infrastructure.

        The customer pays a fixed amount every month for ongoing access. This is the gold standard model for tools that deliver continuous value — monitoring, email sending, analytics, automation, CMS access, or any product where the value compounds over time. Subscription revenue is predictable and compounds, making it the highest-value business model for indie developers who want a sustainable income.

It also removes the "is this worth it?" conversion barrier, since there's no upfront commitment.

The correct design: the free tier should demonstrate your product's value clearly, while hitting a natural ceiling that makes upgrading feel like the obvious next step.

      <h2 class="text-2xl md:text-3xl font-bold">The Psychology of Price Points</h2>
    </div>

    <p class="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-6">
      Pricing is not purely rational. The same product at $50 and $49 converts differently — not because of the dollar saved, but because of how the brain processes numbers. Understanding these effects won't substitute for getting your value proposition right, but it will squeeze meaningful additional revenue from the same traffic once the fundamentals are solid.
    </p>

    <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-white mb-4">Why $49 Beats $50 (And When It Doesn't)</h3>

    <p class="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">
      Charm pricing — ending a price in 9 — exploits the way the brain reads left-to-right. $49 is processed as "40-something" before the 9 registers. $50 reads immediately as "fifty." The mental distance feels larger than a dollar. This effect is well-documented and works across currencies and cultures.
    </p>

    <p class="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-6">
      However: charm pricing signals <em>value</em>, not <em>premium</em>. If you're positioning as a premium, high-end product, round numbers ($100, $200, $500) actually perform better. Apple charges $999 for products despite the charm number being $999, and charges $1,200 for Macs instead of $1,199 — because at a certain price point, round numbers signal quality and confidence. Use charm pricing for <strong class="text-white">sub-$500 products targeting value-conscious buyers</strong>; use round numbers when you're positioning as premium.

    <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-white mb-4">Price Anchoring</h3>

    <p class="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">
      Anchoring is when you show a high reference price first to make your actual price feel like a better deal. Every pricing page that shows an annual plan next to a monthly plan is using anchoring — the monthly price is the anchor that makes the annual price look like a bargain.

    <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-white mb-4">The Rule of Three Pricing Tiers</h3>

    <p class="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">
      Three pricing tiers is the optimal number for conversion. Two tiers force a binary choice and often result in most customers choosing the cheaper option. Four or more tiers cause decision paralysis. Three tiers do something elegant: they create a reference frame that makes the middle tier feel like the intelligent choice.
    </p>

    <div class="p-5 bg-[#0d0d20] border border-white/10 rounded-xl font-mono text-sm mb-6">
      <p class="text-gray-500 mb-3">// The classic three-tier structure</p>
      <p class="text-gray-300 mb-1">tier_1: Basic / Starter  → <span class="text-yellow-400">"for individuals just getting started"</span></p>
      <p class="text-gray-300 mb-1">tier_2: Pro / Growth     → <span class="text-green-400">"most popular" ← highlight this one</span></p>
      <p class="text-gray-300 mb-1">tier_3: Enterprise / Scale → <span class="text-blue-400">"for teams and high volume"</span></p>

      <p class="text-gray-300">tier_1 : tier_2 : tier_3 = 1 : 2.5 : 8</p>
      <p class="text-gray-300">example: $15/mo : $39/mo : $99/mo</p>
    </div>

    <p class="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-6">
      <strong class="text-white">Always highlight the middle tier.</strong> Add a "Most Popular" or "Best Value" badge. Use a visually prominent border or background color. Research consistently shows that the highlighted tier captures 50–70% of all signups. If you want to maximize MRR, make the Pro tier the one you highlight and ensure it has enough features to justify the price over the Basic tier.
    </p>

    <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-white mb-4">Decoy Pricing</h3>

    <p class="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">
      A decoy option is a pricing tier that isn't meant to be chosen — it exists to make another tier look better by comparison. The classic example: a small popcorn for $3 and a large for $7 converts poorly. Add a medium for $6.50, and suddenly the large looks like a deal. The medium is the decoy.
    </p>

    <p class="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-6">
      In dev products, decoy pricing often looks like this: a Basic tier that's deliberately limited (useful for tiny use cases), a Pro tier that's excellent value, and an Enterprise tier that's priced high enough to make Pro look like a steal. The Basic tier can also serve as a decoy — if it's priced close to Pro but offers significantly less, most buyers go straight to Pro.

    </div>

    <p class="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-6">
      Most indie developers are underpriced. They launched at a low price to reduce friction, validated that the product works, and never revisited the number. Raising prices is uncomfortable — it feels like you're being greedy, or that customers will leave. In practice, done correctly, a price increase increases both revenue and customer quality.
    </p>

    <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-white mb-4">Signs You're Underpriced</h3>

    <div class="space-y-3 mb-8">
      <div class="flex items-start gap-3 text-gray-300 text-sm leading-relaxed">
        <span class="text-coral mt-0.5 font-mono text-xs shrink-0">01</span>
        <p><strong class="text-white">Your conversion rate is unusually high.</strong> If 15%+ of trial users convert to paid, your price is too low. A good product at the right price converts 3–8%. High conversion at low price means you have pricing headroom.</p>

        <span class="text-coral mt-0.5 font-mono text-xs shrink-0">02</span>
        <p><strong class="text-white">Nobody objects to the price.</strong> If you never hear "that's a bit expensive" or "can I get a discount?", you're priced below market sensitivity. Some price objections are healthy — they mean you're at the upper edge of what the market will pay.</p>

        <span class="text-coral mt-0.5 font-mono text-xs shrink-0">03</span>
        <p><strong class="text-white">Customers rave about the value.</strong> "This is incredible for the price" or "I can't believe how cheap this is" are direct signals that perceived value far exceeds your price. Customers telling you you're underpriced is about as clear a signal as you'll get.</p>

        <span class="text-coral mt-0.5 font-mono text-xs shrink-0">04</span>
        <p><strong class="text-white">Your churn is very low.</strong> If customers are staying for 12+ months without prompting, the product is deeply embedded in their workflow.

    <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-white mb-4">The Grandfathering Strategy</h3>

    <p class="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">
      When you raise prices, honour existing customers' current rate permanently (or for a defined period, such as 12 months). This is called grandfathering, and it turns a potentially negative event — a price increase — into a positive experience for existing customers. "You're locked in at your current rate forever" is a loyalty reward, not a concession.
    </p>

    <div class="p-5 bg-[#0d0d20] border border-white/10 rounded-xl font-mono text-sm mb-6">

    <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-white mb-4">Framing a Price Increase as an Upgrade</h3>

    <p class="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">
      If you can't grandfather everyone, frame the price increase as a product improvement. Coincide the increase with a significant new feature or capability: "We're launching [Feature X] and moving to a new pricing structure that reflects the expanded value." Customers who are getting more are far more willing to pay more — even if the feature they're getting wasn't something they asked for.

    <p class="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">
      Before committing to a price increase for everyone, test it on new visitors. The simplest approach: change your pricing page to the new price and measure conversion rate for 2-4 weeks against your historical baseline. If the conversion rate drops by less than the percentage increase in price, your revenue goes up even with fewer conversions.

      A money-back guarantee consistently increases conversion by more than it increases refunds. The data is clear: most customers who buy with a guarantee never use it — but having the option removes the risk that was stopping them from buying.
    </p>

      30 days is the industry standard. Put it directly on the pricing page — not buried in the ToS, but next to the CTA button or as a visible trust badge. The copy matters: "30-day money-back guarantee, no questions asked" converts better than "refunds available within 30 days per our terms." The former is a promise; the latter sounds like a legal caveat.
