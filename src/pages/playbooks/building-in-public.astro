    </div>

    <p class="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-6">
      Building in public is not just tweeting your MRR numbers every month. It's not a single "launched on Product Hunt" post. It's not humble-bragging about your $10K month while pretending you're struggling. Real building in public is a systematic approach to transparency that creates value for others while building trust in you.
    </p>

    <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-white mb-4 mt-10">The Spectrum of Transparency</h3>

    <p class="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-6">
      There's a full spectrum between fully private and fully transparent. Most founders oscillate between the extremes — either sharing nothing or oversharing everything — without being strategic about it. Here's how to think about the levels:
    </p>

    <div class="space-y-4 mb-8">
      <div class="flex items-start gap-4 p-4 rounded-xl bg-white/[0.03] border border-white/5">

        <div>
          <p class="font-semibold text-white mb-1">Fully Private</p>
          <p class="text-gray-400 text-sm leading-relaxed">You build in silence. Nobody knows what you're working on until launch day. This is the default mode for most developers — and it's a massive missed opportunity.</p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="flex items-start gap-4 p-4 rounded-xl bg-white/[0.03] border border-white/5">

        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="flex items-start gap-4 p-4 rounded-xl bg-white/[0.03] border border-white/5">

          <p class="text-gray-400 text-sm leading-relaxed">You share revenue milestones, user counts, and growth charts. This is what most people think "building in public" means. It's good, but it's not enough.</p>

          <p class="text-gray-400 text-sm leading-relaxed">Everything is public: revenue, expenses, code, decisions, failures. Only a few founders operate here. It's powerful but not required for success.</p>
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>

    <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-white mb-4 mt-10">Why Transparency Builds Trust Faster</h3>

    <p class="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-6">
      People buy from people they trust. In the absence of a brand name like Google or Apple, trust is your only competitive advantage as an indie developer. And nothing builds trust faster than transparency.
    </p>

    <p class="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-6">
      When you share your process — the struggles, the pivots, the late nights, the small wins — you become a real person instead of a faceless product. Your audience starts rooting for you. They want you to succeed. And when you finally launch (or re-launch), they're already invested in your story.
    </p>

    <div class="bg-navy-light border border-white/10 rounded-xl p-6 mb-6">
      <p class="text-sm font-semibold text-coral mb-3">The DRM Angle</p>
      <p class="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
        Building in public is a long-form content strategy that compounds. Every post is an asset that continues working for you. A Twitter thread from six months ago can still bring traffic today. An Indie Hackers post can rank in Google for years. Unlike paid ads that stop working when you stop paying, build-in-public content is an investment with compounding returns. It's direct response marketing at the speed of trust.
      </p>
    </div>

    <p class="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
      The key insight: you're not just building a product. You're building an audience while you build the product. And that audience becomes your first customers, your beta testers, your word-of-mouth engine, and your safety net when things go wrong.

    </div>

    <p class="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-6">
      The most common mistake in building in public: you build an audience but never sell to them. You post for months, gain thousands of followers, launch your product... and hear crickets. Here's how to avoid that trap.
    </p>

    <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-white mb-4 mt-10">The Audience-First Mistake</h3>

    <p class="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-6">
      Followers are not customers. Someone who likes your tweets is not the same as someone who will pay for your product. The gap between audience and customers is where most build-in-public efforts die.
    </p>

    <p class="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-6">
      The fix: sell from day one. Not aggressively. Not constantly. But make it clear that you're building a business, not just a following. Mention your product. Share your pricing decisions. Talk about your business model. The people who are interested in buying will self-select.
    </p>

    <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-white mb-4 mt-10">The Soft Pitch</h3>

    <p class="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-6">
      You don't need to be salesy to sell. The soft pitch is about mentioning your product naturally in the context of sharing your journey. Instead of "Buy my product," it's "Here's what I learned building this feature for [product name]."
    </p>

    <div class="space-y-4 mb-8">
      <div class="p-4 bg-[#0d0d20] border border-white/10 rounded-xl">
        <p class="text-gray-500 mb-2">&#10060; Too salesy:</p>

      <div class="p-4 bg-[#0d0d20] border border-white/10 rounded-xl">

      </div>
    </div>

    <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-white mb-4 mt-10">The Launch Moment</h3>

    <p class="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-6">
      Building in public sets up your product launch perfectly. Your audience has watched you build it. They've given feedback. They feel invested in your success. When you finally say "It's live," they're ready to buy.
    </p>

    <p class="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-6">
      But you have to ask. The launch post needs a clear CTA. "It's live" is not enough. "It's live, here's the link, and here's why you should try it" is what converts.
