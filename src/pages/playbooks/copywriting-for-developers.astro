      <h2 class="text-2xl md:text-3xl font-bold">Why Developers Hate Writing Copy (And Why That's Fixable)</h2>
    </div>

    <p class="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-6">
      You built something real. It solves a real problem. Now you need to write a landing page, and you open a blank document and sit there for 45 minutes staring at the cursor. Sound familiar?
    </p>

    <p class="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-6">
      Developers aren't bad at writing. Most developers are excellent technical writers — READMEs, API docs, internal specs. The block isn't writing ability. It's a specific mismatch between how your brain is trained to communicate and what marketing copy actually requires.
    </p>

    <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-white mb-4 mt-10">The Developer Brain: Precision Over Persuasion</h3>

    <p class="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-6">
      When you write documentation, the goal is accuracy. You want to be complete, correct, and precise. Every edge case documented. Every parameter explained. Ambiguity is a bug.
    </p>

    <p class="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-6">
      Sales copy feels like the opposite. It's vague, emotional, and incomplete on purpose. "Ship 10x faster" — that's not true in every case. "Your users will love it" — how do you know? The precision instinct kicks in and you start hedging: "In many common scenarios, you may experience performance improvements of varying magnitude..." Now you've written nothing anyone will read.
    </p>

    <p class="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-6">
      There's also the "salesy" feeling. Developers are trained to distrust marketing. We skip ads, install uBlock, mute promotional emails. Writing copy feels like becoming the enemy — the slick marketer pushing something that doesn't deliver. It feels dishonest.
    </p>

    <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-white mb-4 mt-10">The Good News: Copy Is a System, Not a Talent</h3>

    <p class="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-6">
      Here's the reframe that makes everything easier: <strong class="text-white">DRM copywriting is systematic, not creative</strong>. The best direct response copy isn't poetic. It isn't clever. It doesn't require inspiration. It follows proven patterns that work reliably across products, audiences, and markets.
    </p>

    <div class="bg-navy-light border border-white/10 rounded-xl p-6 mb-6">
      <p class="text-sm font-semibold text-coral mb-3">Developer Analogy</p>
      <p class="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
        Think of copywriting frameworks the way you think of design patterns. You don't reinvent a singleton or an observer from scratch every time. You recognize the pattern, apply it to your context, and move on. Copy frameworks are the same. You don't write a headline — you fill in the <code class="text-coral bg-coral/10 px-1.5 py-0.5 rounded font-mono text-sm">Headline</code> pattern with your product's specifics.
      </p>
    </div>

    <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-white mb-4 mt-10">Reframe: Copy Is Documentation for Humans Who Need to Be Convinced</h3>

    <p class="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-6">
      Technical documentation informs. Sales copy convinces. That's the only difference. Your README tells a developer how to use your API. Your landing page tells a potential customer <em>why</em> they should bother learning how.
    </p>

    <p class="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-6">
      You're not being dishonest. You're writing the README for the decision to buy. You're helping someone understand what changes for them, why that matters, and what to do next. That's not manipulation — it's useful communication.
    </p>

  <section id="copy-hierarchy" class="playbook-section mb-16 scroll-mt-24">
    <div class="flex items-center gap-3 mb-6">
      <span class="flex items-center justify-center w-10 h-10 rounded-xl bg-coral/10 text-coral font-mono font-bold text-sm border border-coral/20">02</span>
      <h2 class="text-2xl md:text-3xl font-bold">The Copy Hierarchy: What to Write First</h2>
    </div>

    <p class="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-6">
      Most developers make the mistake of writing copy top to bottom: they start with the headline, get stuck, spend an hour tweaking it, then run out of energy before they reach the parts that actually convert. Wrong order.
    </p>

    <p class="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-6">
      Copy has a hierarchy. Not all elements are equal. Some matter enormously. Some are almost irrelevant. Here's the order of impact, from highest to lowest — and the order you should actually write them.
    </p>

    <div class="space-y-4 mb-10">
      <!-- 1: Headline -->
      <div class="flex items-start gap-4 p-5 rounded-xl bg-white/[0.03] border border-coral/20">
        <span class="flex items-center justify-center w-9 h-9 rounded-lg bg-coral/10 text-coral font-mono font-bold text-sm shrink-0">1</span>
        <div>
          <div class="flex items-center gap-3 mb-2">
            <p class="font-semibold text-white">Headline</p>
            <span class="px-2 py-0.5 rounded-full bg-coral/15 text-coral text-xs font-mono">highest leverage</span>
          </div>
          <p class="text-gray-400 text-sm leading-relaxed">
            The most important line you'll write. According to David Ogilvy, 5x more people read your headline than anything else on the page. If the headline doesn't work, nothing else matters. Every visitor makes their "keep reading or leave" decision here.
          </p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <!-- 2: Subheadline -->
      <div class="flex items-start gap-4 p-5 rounded-xl bg-white/[0.03] border border-white/5">
        <span class="flex items-center justify-center w-9 h-9 rounded-lg bg-white/5 text-gray-400 font-mono font-bold text-sm shrink-0">2</span>
        <div>
          <p class="font-semibold text-white mb-2">Subheadline</p>
          <p class="text-gray-400 text-sm leading-relaxed">
            The subheadline is the second thing everyone reads. It buys the curious visitor a second longer and clarifies the promise. It answers: "For who? How? What makes it different?" Where the headline is broad and bold, the subheadline is specific and grounding.
          </p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <!-- 3: Benefits list -->
      <div class="flex items-start gap-4 p-5 rounded-xl bg-white/[0.03] border border-white/5">
        <span class="flex items-center justify-center w-9 h-9 rounded-lg bg-white/5 text-gray-400 font-mono font-bold text-sm shrink-0">3</span>
        <div>
          <p class="font-semibold text-white mb-2">Benefits List</p>
          <p class="text-gray-400 text-sm leading-relaxed">
            Three to five outcomes the customer gets. Not features — what those features do for the customer's life. Written as bullets, they're scannable and concrete. This is where you turn "real-time sync" into "always up to date across every device, automatically."
          </p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <!-- 4: CTA -->
      <div class="flex items-start gap-4 p-5 rounded-xl bg-white/[0.03] border border-white/5">
        <span class="flex items-center justify-center w-9 h-9 rounded-lg bg-white/5 text-gray-400 font-mono font-bold text-sm shrink-0">4</span>
        <div>
          <p class="font-semibold text-white mb-2">CTA Button</p>
          <p class="text-gray-400 text-sm leading-relaxed">
            The button text is where the conversion literally happens. It needs to describe what the visitor gets when they click — not what they're doing. "Start Building Free" beats "Sign Up" every time. Short, action-oriented, outcome-focused.
          </p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <!-- 5: Everything else -->
      <div class="flex items-start gap-4 p-5 rounded-xl bg-white/[0.03] border border-white/5">
        <span class="flex items-center justify-center w-9 h-9 rounded-lg bg-white/5 text-gray-400 font-mono font-bold text-sm shrink-0">5</span>
        <div>
          <p class="font-semibold text-white mb-2">Everything Else</p>
          <p class="text-gray-400 text-sm leading-relaxed">
            Body copy, FAQ, testimonials, feature descriptions, footer copy. This all matters — but it matters far less than the elements above. Many visitors never reach it. Write it last and with the least effort per word.
          </p>
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>

    <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-white mb-4">Why Spending 80% of Your Time on the Headline Is Correct</h3>

    <p class="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-6">
      This sounds extreme. It isn't. A bad headline means most visitors never read your benefits list, your testimonials, or your CTA. You could have the best body copy ever written and it's invisible — because people already left.
    </p>

    <p class="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-6">
      Experienced copywriters routinely write 25-50 headline variations before picking one. Not because writing is hard — because testing your assumptions against many options surfaces the real insight. The fifth headline is always better than the first. The fifteenth is usually the best.
    </p>

    <div class="p-4 bg-[#0d0d20] border border-white/10 rounded-xl font-mono text-sm mb-6">
      <p class="text-gray-500 mb-3">// Rough time allocation for a new landing page</p>

      <p class="text-white/70 mb-1">Subheadline + benefits:            ~20%</p>

      <p class="text-white/70">Body copy (everything else):       ~25%</p>

      <p class="text-white font-medium leading-relaxed">

    </div>

    <p class="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-6">
      You don't need to stare at a blank page. You need a template and a real example. Here are four battle-tested frameworks used in direct response copy across every industry. For each one: what it is, the fill-in-the-blank template, and a developer product example.
    </p>

    <!-- Framework 1: PAS -->
    <div class="mb-10">
      <div class="flex items-center gap-3 mb-4">
        <span class="flex items-center justify-center w-8 h-8 rounded-lg bg-coral/10 text-coral font-mono text-xs font-bold shrink-0">PAS</span>
        <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-white">Problem → Agitate → Solution</h3>
      </div>

      <p class="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">
        PAS is the most versatile framework in direct response. It works for landing pages, email subject lines, ads, and sales sequences. Name the problem, twist the knife to make the pain feel urgent, then present your product as the relief.
      </p>

      <div class="p-5 bg-[#0d0d20] border border-white/10 rounded-xl font-mono text-sm mb-4">

        <p class="text-green-400">Solution: "[Introduce your product as the direct fix]"</p>

    </div>

    <p class="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-6">
      "The first draft of anything is shit." That's Hemingway's rule, and it applies directly to copy. The frameworks and templates give you a solid rough draft. Editing is where copy becomes sharp. The goal of the Hemingway Pass is to cut everything that doesn't earn its place.

    <p class="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-6">
      Run through each of these passes in order. Each one targets a different class of weakness.

      <p class="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">
        Read each sentence and ask: does this word add meaning or does it fill space? Filler words are the enemy of impact. Common offenders: "very," "really," "just," "quite," "a bit," "in order to," "the fact that," "it is worth noting."

    <p class="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">
      Generic prompts produce generic copy. The more context you give, the better the output. Always include: (1) who the customer is, (2) what the product does, (3) the single most important outcome, and (4) the framework you want to use.
    </p>

    <p class="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-6">
      Here are five prompts you can use right now. Copy and adapt — replace the bracketed sections with your product's specifics.
    </p>

    <!-- Prompt 1 -->
    <div class="mb-6">
      <p class="text-sm font-semibold text-coral mb-2">Prompt 1 — PAS Copy Block</p>
      <div class="p-5 bg-[#0d0d20] border border-white/10 rounded-xl font-mono text-sm leading-relaxed">
        <p class="text-gray-300">Write a short PAS (Problem-Agitate-Solution) copy block for a landing page. Product: [your product]. Customer: [solo developers / indie hackers / SaaS founders]. Problem they face: [specific problem]. Solution: [what your product does to fix it]. Keep each part to 2-3 sentences. Be specific — use numbers where possible. Do not use generic phrases like "powerful," "seamless," or "robust."</p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <!-- Prompt 2 -->
    <div class="mb-6">
      <p class="text-sm font-semibold text-coral mb-2">Prompt 2 — Headline Variations</p>
      <div class="p-5 bg-[#0d0d20] border border-white/10 rounded-xl font-mono text-sm leading-relaxed">
        <p class="text-gray-300">Generate 10 landing page headline variations for [product]. The main outcome is [specific outcome]. The audience is [target audience]. Use these headline formulas: (1) "[outcome] without [pain]", (2) "[outcome] in [timeframe]", (3) "Stop [pain]. Start [outcome].", (4) "The [adjective] way to [outcome]", (5) "[number] [audience] use [product] to [outcome]". Write two variants per formula. Be specific and avoid generic marketing language.</p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <!-- Prompt 3 -->
    <div class="mb-6">
      <p class="text-sm font-semibold text-coral mb-2">Prompt 3 — FAB Feature Cards</p>
      <div class="p-5 bg-[#0d0d20] border border-white/10 rounded-xl font-mono text-sm leading-relaxed">
        <p class="text-gray-300">Rewrite these product features as Feature-Advantage-Benefit (FAB) copy for a landing page feature grid. For each, write: a bold benefit headline (under 8 words), one sentence for the advantage, one sentence for the emotional payoff. Features to convert: [paste your feature list here]. Audience: [target audience].</p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <!-- Prompt 4 -->
    <div class="mb-6">
      <p class="text-sm font-semibold text-coral mb-2">Prompt 4 — Email Subject Lines</p>
      <div class="p-5 bg-[#0d0d20] border border-white/10 rounded-xl font-mono text-sm leading-relaxed">
        <p class="text-gray-300">Write 10 email subject lines for [type of email: welcome / launch / re-engagement / feature announcement]. Product: [product]. Audience: [audience]. Goal: [what you want them to do]. Include: 3 curiosity-based, 3 benefit-focused, 2 with specific numbers, and 2 that address a common objection. Keep all under 50 characters. No emojis.</p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <!-- Prompt 5 -->

        <p class="text-gray-300">Edit this copy using the Hemingway rules: (1) cut every word that doesn't add meaning, (2) replace passive voice with active, (3) replace vague adjectives like "powerful," "fast," "better" with specific numbers or comparisons, (4) after each sentence, ask "so what?" and expand if the benefit isn't clear. Return the edited version and a brief note on what you changed. Copy: [paste your copy here]</p>

    <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-white mb-4">How to Edit AI Output to Sound Human</h3>

    <p class="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">
      AI copy is usually grammatically correct and structurally sound — and unmistakably bland. After you get output, do these three things:
    </p>

    <div class="space-y-4 mb-8">
      <div class="flex items-start gap-4 p-4 rounded-xl bg-white/[0.03] border border-white/5">
        <span class="text-coral font-mono text-sm shrink-0 mt-0.5">01</span>
        <div>
          <p class="font-semibold text-white mb-1">Replace the generic with the specific</p>
          <p class="text-gray-400 text-sm leading-relaxed">AI writes "significantly reduce time" — you know it's "save 4 hours per deploy." AI writes "many developers" — you know it's "indie hackers shipping their first SaaS." Every generic phrase is a slot to fill with your real knowledge.</p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="flex items-start gap-4 p-4 rounded-xl bg-white/[0.03] border border-white/5">
        <span class="text-coral font-mono text-sm shrink-0 mt-0.5">02</span>
        <div>
          <p class="font-semibold text-white mb-1">Read it out loud</p>
          <p class="text-gray-400 text-sm leading-relaxed">If you stumble or it sounds weird spoken, it'll read weird on the page. AI tends toward formal. Your copy should sound like a smart person talking. If you wouldn't say it at a meetup, rewrite it.</p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="flex items-start gap-4 p-4 rounded-xl bg-white/[0.03] border border-white/5">
        <span class="text-coral font-mono text-sm shrink-0 mt-0.5">03</span>
        <div>
          <p class="font-semibold text-white mb-1">Add one thing only you know</p>
          <p class="text-gray-400 text-sm leading-relaxed">An insider detail from your beta, a weird edge case that turns out to be the most common use case, the exact phrase your first customer used to describe their problem. AI can't know these. One real insight makes AI copy feel completely authentic.</p>
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>

    <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-white mb-4">The One Thing AI Can't Do: Know Your Customer's Exact Language</h3>

    <p class="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-6">
      The single most powerful thing in sales copy is using the customer's own words back at them. Not paraphrased — <em>verbatim</em>. When someone reads their exact inner monologue in your copy, the feeling is "this product is made for me."
    </p>

    <p class="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">
      AI can approximate. But it can't know that your users say "I hate waiting for Vercel to finish building" instead of "deployment speed is a concern." Or that they describe the pain as "feels like I'm flying blind" not "lacks observability."
    </p>

    <p class="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-6">
      To get this language: talk to your first 10 users. Read your support tickets. Search Reddit and Hacker News for threads about your problem space. Read the 1-star reviews of your competitors on G2 or Product Hunt. The exact words people use when venting are the exact words that should be in your copy.
