      <h2 class="text-2xl md:text-3xl font-bold">Why Your Current Landing Page Isn't Converting</h2>
    </div>

    <p class="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-6">
      You spent weeks building a product, shipped it, made a landing page, posted it on Twitter, and got... crickets. A few visitors, zero signups. So you tweak the colors. Add more features to the list. Redesign the hero image. Still nothing.
    </p>

    <p class="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-6">
      Here's the uncomfortable truth: the problem isn't your design and it isn't your product. It's almost certainly your <strong class="text-white">messaging</strong>. You're making the same mistakes that 90% of developer-founders make on their landing pages. Let's name them so you can fix them.
    </p>

    <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-white mb-4 mt-10">The Five Deadly Mistakes</h3>

        <div>
          <p class="font-semibold text-white mb-1">Leading with features instead of outcomes</p>
          <p class="text-gray-400 text-sm leading-relaxed">Your headline says "Built with Rust, WASM, and edge functions" when it should say "Deploy in 30 seconds, globally." Nobody cares about your tech stack until they care about the result. The technology is <em>how</em> you deliver the result — it's not the result itself.</p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="flex items-start gap-4 p-4 rounded-xl bg-white/[0.03] border border-white/5">

          <p class="text-gray-400 text-sm leading-relaxed">You have "Star on GitHub," "Join Discord," "Read Docs," "Watch Demo," and "Sign Up" all competing for attention. The visitor's brain freezes. One page, one primary action. Everything else is a distraction.</p>

          <p class="font-semibold text-white mb-1">Feature-dumping without context</p>
          <p class="text-gray-400 text-sm leading-relaxed">A wall of 20 features in tiny cards tells visitors nothing about <em>why</em> any of them matter. Each feature needs to answer "so what?" — what does this mean for me? Feature-dumping is documentation, not marketing.</p>

        <div>
          <p class="font-semibold text-white mb-1">Zero social proof</p>
          <p class="text-gray-400 text-sm leading-relaxed">No testimonials, no user count, no logos, no GitHub stars — nothing that says "other people trust this." Social proof is the fastest shortcut to credibility. Without it, visitors have to take your word for everything.</p>

        <div>
          <p class="font-semibold text-white mb-1">Confusing layout with no hierarchy</p>
          <p class="text-gray-400 text-sm leading-relaxed">The eye doesn't know where to look. There's no visual flow guiding the visitor from headline → value → proof → action. Great landing pages are a controlled slide — every section leads to the next, and the whole page funnels toward the CTA.</p>
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>

    <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-white mb-4 mt-10">The Developer Mindset Trap</h3>

    <p class="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-6">
      Developers fall into a specific trap: because <em>you</em> evaluate tools by their features, you assume your customers do too. So you list every feature, every integration, every technical detail. You think comprehensiveness equals persuasion.
    </p>

    <p class="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-6">
      It doesn't. Even when selling to other developers, people don't buy features — they buy outcomes wrapped in confidence. They want to know: "Will this solve my problem? Can I trust it? How fast can I get the result?" Your landing page needs to answer those three questions, in that order, before getting into the technical details.
    </p>

    <div class="bg-navy-light border border-white/10 rounded-xl p-6 mb-6">
      <p class="text-sm font-semibold text-coral mb-3">Developer Analogy</p>
      <p class="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
        Think of your landing page as a function with one job: <code class="text-coral bg-coral/10 px-1.5 py-0.5 rounded font-mono text-sm">convert(visitor) → signup</code>. If the function has too many parameters, unclear return types, and no documentation, nobody will use it. A good landing page is a clean, well-documented API with a single endpoint and a clear contract.
      </p>
    </div>

    <p class="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
      The rest of this playbook gives you the exact blueprint to rebuild your landing page — section by section, with templates for every piece of copy. Let's start with the full layout.
    </p>
  </section>

  <!-- Section 2 -->
  <section id="blueprint" class="playbook-section mb-16 scroll-mt-24">
    <div class="flex items-center gap-3 mb-6">
      <span class="flex items-center justify-center w-10 h-10 rounded-xl bg-coral/10 text-coral font-mono font-bold text-sm border border-coral/20">02</span>
      <h2 class="text-2xl md:text-3xl font-bold">The 10-Section Landing Page Blueprint</h2>
    </div>

    <p class="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-6">
      Every high-converting SaaS landing page follows a predictable structure. Not because marketers are uncreative — because it works. Visitors have expectations. They scroll top to bottom. Each section has a psychological job. Here's the complete blueprint, in order.
    </p>

    <!-- Section 1: Navigation -->
    <div class="mb-10">
      <div class="flex items-center gap-3 mb-3">
        <span class="flex items-center justify-center w-7 h-7 rounded-md bg-coral/10 text-coral font-mono text-xs font-bold shrink-0">1</span>
        <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-white">Navigation — Minimal, Not Maximal</h3>
      </div>
      <p class="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">
        Your landing page navigation should have: your logo on the left and a single CTA button on the right. That's it. No "Blog" link, no "About" page, no "Docs." Every link is an exit ramp that takes people away from your conversion goal. Some pages skip navigation entirely — and that's a valid choice.
      </p>
      <div class="p-4 bg-[#0d0d20] border border-white/10 rounded-xl font-mono text-sm">
        <p class="text-gray-500 mb-2">// Navigation structure</p>
        <p class="text-gray-300"><span class="text-coral">[Logo]</span> ——————————————————— <span class="text-green-400">[Start Free Trial →]</span></p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <!-- Section 2: Hero -->
    <div class="mb-10">
      <div class="flex items-center gap-3 mb-3">
        <span class="flex items-center justify-center w-7 h-7 rounded-md bg-coral/10 text-coral font-mono text-xs font-bold shrink-0">2</span>
        <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-white">Hero Section — Your 5-Second Pitch</h3>
      </div>
      <p class="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">
        The hero is the most important section on the page. Visitors decide in under 5 seconds whether to keep scrolling or bounce. You need four elements:
      </p>
      <div class="space-y-2 mb-4">
        <div class="flex items-start gap-3 text-gray-300 text-sm">
          <span class="text-coral mt-0.5">&#9656;</span>
          <p><strong class="text-white">Headline:</strong> The #1 outcome your product delivers. Not a feature — a result. "Ship your SaaS this weekend" beats "Full-stack boilerplate template."</p>
        </div>
        <div class="flex items-start gap-3 text-gray-300 text-sm">
          <span class="text-coral mt-0.5">&#9656;</span>
          <p><strong class="text-white">Subheadline:</strong> How you deliver that outcome. Add specificity — who it's for, what makes it different.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="flex items-start gap-3 text-gray-300 text-sm">
          <span class="text-coral mt-0.5">&#9656;</span>
          <p><strong class="text-white">CTA button:</strong> One primary action. Use value-driven text, not "Submit."</p>
        </div>
        <div class="flex items-start gap-3 text-gray-300 text-sm">
          <span class="text-coral mt-0.5">&#9656;</span>
          <p><strong class="text-white">Product visual:</strong> A screenshot, animated demo, or short video. Proves your product exists and looks good.</p>
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>

    <!-- Section 3: Social Proof Bar -->
    <div class="mb-10">
      <div class="flex items-center gap-3 mb-3">
        <span class="flex items-center justify-center w-7 h-7 rounded-md bg-coral/10 text-coral font-mono text-xs font-bold shrink-0">3</span>
        <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-white">Social Proof Bar — Instant Credibility</h3>
      </div>
      <p class="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">
        Right below the hero, add a thin strip of credibility signals: company logos, "Trusted by 2,500 developers," a row of star ratings, or a short testimonial snippet. This immediately tells the visitor "other people use this — it's safe." Even small numbers work. "Used by 150 developers" is infinitely better than nothing. If you have GitHub stars, use them. If you have a Product Hunt badge, show it.
      </p>
    </div>

    <!-- Section 4: Problem -->
    <div class="mb-10">
      <div class="flex items-center gap-3 mb-3">
        <span class="flex items-center justify-center w-7 h-7 rounded-md bg-coral/10 text-coral font-mono text-xs font-bold shrink-0">4</span>
        <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-white">Problem Section — Name Their Pain</h3>
      </div>
      <p class="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">
        Before you pitch your solution, make the visitor feel the problem. Describe their current frustration in specific, relatable terms. "You spend hours configuring auth, fighting with token refresh, and debugging session management — instead of building the features that actually make you money." The more specific you are, the more the reader thinks "this person gets me." Use 2-3 bullet points that describe their daily pain.
      </p>
    </div>

    <!-- Section 5: Solution -->
    <div class="mb-10">
      <div class="flex items-center gap-3 mb-3">
        <span class="flex items-center justify-center w-7 h-7 rounded-md bg-coral/10 text-coral font-mono text-xs font-bold shrink-0">5</span>
        <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-white">Solution Section — Introduce the Hero</h3>
      </div>
      <p class="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">
        Now introduce your product as the answer to the problem you just described. Use a transition like "There's a better way" or "What if you didn't have to?" Then explain your product in one or two sentences, focusing on the transformation: "AuthKit gives you drop-in authentication that just works — social login, MFA, and passwordless in 15 minutes. So you can get back to building what matters." Keep it brief. This isn't the feature section — it's the bridge from problem to solution.
      </p>
    </div>

    <!-- Section 6: Features/Benefits -->
    <div class="mb-10">
      <div class="flex items-center gap-3 mb-3">
        <span class="flex items-center justify-center w-7 h-7 rounded-md bg-coral/10 text-coral font-mono text-xs font-bold shrink-0">6</span>
        <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-white">Features/Benefits — The FAB Section</h3>
      </div>
      <p class="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">
        Pick 3-4 of your most important features and translate each one into a benefit using the Feature → Advantage → Benefit framework. Display them in a grid or alternating layout with icons or small visuals. Each card should have a bold benefit headline, a one-sentence explanation, and optionally a small screenshot or icon.
      </p>
      <div class="p-4 bg-[#0d0d20] border border-white/10 rounded-xl font-mono text-sm">
        <p class="text-gray-500 mb-2">// Don't write this:</p>
        <p class="text-red-400 mb-4">"Multi-region edge caching with 200+ PoPs"</p>
        <p class="text-gray-500 mb-2">// Write this instead:</p>

        <p class="text-gray-400 text-xs">Your app loads in under 100ms for every user, everywhere. Built on 200+ edge locations so speed is never a bottleneck.</p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <!-- Section 7: How It Works -->
    <div class="mb-10">
      <div class="flex items-center gap-3 mb-3">
        <span class="flex items-center justify-center w-7 h-7 rounded-md bg-coral/10 text-coral font-mono text-xs font-bold shrink-0">7</span>
        <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-white">How It Works — The 3-Step Process</h3>
      </div>
      <p class="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">
        Reduce the complexity of your product to exactly three steps. Even if your product has 50 features and a complex setup, <em>simplify it for the landing page</em>. Three steps makes it feel achievable. The pattern is always: (1) Start/sign up, (2) Connect/configure, (3) Get the result. For example: "1. Install the package → 2. Add your API key → 3. Auth just works." Use numbered cards with a brief description and optional icon for each step.
      </p>
    </div>

    <!-- Section 8: Testimonials -->
    <div class="mb-10">
      <div class="flex items-center gap-3 mb-3">
        <span class="flex items-center justify-center w-7 h-7 rounded-md bg-coral/10 text-coral font-mono text-xs font-bold shrink-0">8</span>
        <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-white">Testimonials — Let Others Sell for You</h3>
      </div>
      <p class="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">
        Full-length testimonials are one of the highest-converting elements on any landing page. Each testimonial should include: the person's name, their role/company, a photo (even a small avatar), and most importantly — a <strong class="text-white">specific result</strong>. "Great tool!" is useless. "We cut our onboarding time from 3 weeks to 2 days" is gold. If you don't have testimonials yet, reach out to 5 beta users and ask them one question: "What changed for you after using [product]?"
      </p>
    </div>

    <!-- Section 9: Pricing -->
    <div class="mb-10">
      <div class="flex items-center gap-3 mb-3">
        <span class="flex items-center justify-center w-7 h-7 rounded-md bg-coral/10 text-coral font-mono text-xs font-bold shrink-0">9</span>
        <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-white">Pricing — Transparent and Simple</h3>
      </div>
      <p class="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">
        Developers hate hidden pricing. Show your plans clearly: a free tier (if you have one), one or two paid tiers, and visually highlight the recommended option with a colored border or "Most Popular" badge. Each tier should list what's included in short bullet points. If you offer annual billing, show the monthly equivalent with a savings badge. Include your guarantee or risk reversal directly in the pricing section — "30-day money-back guarantee" under the buy button removes the last objection.
      </p>
    </div>

    <!-- Section 10: Final CTA -->
    <div class="mb-10">
      <div class="flex items-center gap-3 mb-3">
        <span class="flex items-center justify-center w-7 h-7 rounded-md bg-coral/10 text-coral font-mono text-xs font-bold shrink-0">10</span>
        <h3 class="text-lg font-semibold text-white">Final CTA — Close the Deal</h3>
      </div>
      <p class="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">
        Repeat your hero headline and CTA one more time at the bottom of the page. The visitor has now scrolled through your entire pitch — this is where they decide. Add a nudge: a guarantee reminder ("Risk-free for 30 days"), urgency ("Launch pricing ends Friday"), or a micro-testimonial. Keep this section clean: headline, one line of copy, and a big, prominent button.
      </p>

    <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-white mb-4 mt-10">How to Choose the Right Formula</h3>

    <p class="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-6">
      Pick the formula that matches your product's biggest strength. If your product is fast, use Formula 4 (timeframe comparison). If you have strong social proof, use Formula 5 (numbers). If you're entering a market full of complex alternatives, use Formula 10 (simplicity). Don't overthink it — write 3-5 variations using different formulas, then A/B test the top two on your live page.

    </div>

    <p class="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-6">
      Your CTA button is where conversion literally happens. It's the one element every visitor either clicks or doesn't. Yet most developers throw "Submit" or "Sign Up" on their button and call it done. These are lazy CTAs that communicate nothing about what happens next or what the user gets.
    </p>

    <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-white mb-4 mt-10">Why "Submit" and "Sign Up" Fail</h3>

    <p class="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-6">
      "Submit" is the worst CTA in existence. It literally means "surrender." Nobody wants to submit anything. "Sign Up" is slightly better but still describes a chore, not a reward. These generic CTAs fail because they describe the <em>action the user takes</em> instead of the <em>value the user gets</em>. The fix is simple: make your button text about the outcome, not the process.
