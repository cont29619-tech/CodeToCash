You can write a README. You can document an API. You can write a 400-line `CONTRIBUTING.md` that no one will ever read. But when someone asks you to write a landing page for your SaaS, your brain goes blank.

This is the developer's curse. You know your product inside-out — the architecture, the edge cases, the clever bit of logic in the auth flow — but translating that into words that make strangers hand over their email address? That feels like a different skill entirely.

It is not. **SaaS landing page copywriting** is engineering applied to language. It has inputs, outputs, and testable conversion rates. The frameworks exist. You just need to learn them once.

This guide gives you a complete system: the mental model, the section-by-section breakdown, fill-in-the-blank templates, and the exact copy patterns that convert. No filler. No "make sure your copy resonates with your audience." Actual templates you can use today.

If you want the broader marketing context first, read the [DRM 101 guide](/drm-101) — it explains how landing pages fit into your sales pipeline. But if you are here to write copy right now, let us get into it.

## The ONE Job of a Landing Page (It Is Not Explaining Features)

Before you write a single word, get this straight: a landing page has exactly one job.

Not "explain what your product does." Not "showcase all your features." Not "establish credibility." One job: **get the visitor to take the next action** — sign up, start a trial, or click through to a pricing page.

That is it. Every word on the page either serves that goal or it should be deleted.

Most developers build feature pages by accident. They list what the product does — the API endpoints, the integrations, the data model. Visitors read it, think "interesting," and leave. No conversion. No email. No revenue.

Here is the mental model shift: your visitor does not care what your product does. They care what it does **for them**. Specifically, they care about the outcome they get and the pain they escape. Features are the mechanism. Copy sells the result.

According to [Unbounce's conversion benchmark report](https://unbounce.com/landing-page-articles/landing-page-best-practices/), the average SaaS landing page converts at around 3–5%. The top performers hit 10–15%. The difference is almost never design. It is the clarity and relevance of the copy.

This is the gap we are closing.

## Hero Section: The Three Lines That Decide Everything

Eighty percent of visitors never scroll past the hero. If your headline does not hook them in under five seconds, you lost them. The hero section is your highest-leverage piece of SaaS landing page copywriting.

A hero needs three things:

1. **Headline** — what the visitor gets
2. **Subheadline** — who it is for and why it works
3. **CTA button** — the single action you want them to take

### The Headline Formula

Bad headline: "AI-Powered Project Management for Teams"

Good headline: "Ship Projects Without the Status Meeting Tax"

The difference: the bad headline describes a category. The good headline describes an outcome (shipping projects) and eliminates a specific pain (status meetings). Visitors can see themselves in it immediately.

Formula: `[Achieve Desired Outcome] Without [Biggest Pain Point]`

More examples:
- "Get Your First 1,000 Newsletter Subscribers Without Running Ads"
- "Close Enterprise Deals Without a Sales Team"
- "Deploy to Production Without Touching a Config File"

Your subheadline does the explaining. It can be one or two sentences: who this is for, and why the approach works. Example: "GitDeploy connects directly to your repo and auto-configures your infrastructure. Zero YAML. Zero guesswork."

Your CTA button should say what happens next, not what you want. "Start Free Trial" beats "Get Started." "See It In Action" beats "Learn More." "Grab My Free Audit" beats "Submit."

## Problem Section: Make Them Feel Understood Before You Pitch

Most landing pages jump straight from hero to features. This is a mistake. Visitors are not ready to hear about your solution until they feel like you understand their problem.

The problem section does one thing: it names the pain so accurately that the visitor thinks "yes, exactly — how did they know?"

This is not manipulation. It is empathy. And it is the reason the PAS framework (Problem, Agitate, Solution) is one of the most effective structures in copywriting. If you are not familiar with it, read the full breakdown in the [PAS framework post](/blog/pas-copywriting-framework).

For a SaaS landing page, the problem section usually works best as three short bullet points or problem cards. Each card names a symptom the visitor recognizes:

- "You spent three hours debugging a deployment that worked locally"
- "Your Stripe dashboard says revenue is up but you don't know why"
- "You launched, tweeted once, and then nothing happened"

Concrete, specific, relatable. No jargon. No "inefficient workflows." Name the exact moment of frustration.

After three problem points, bridge to your solution with a single sentence: "There is a better way." Then move to features — but frame each feature as the solution to a specific problem you just named.

## Features Section: Benefits, Then Mechanics

Features tell. Benefits sell. You have heard this before, but let us make it operational.

**Feature**: "Automatic infrastructure scaling"

**Benefit**: "Your app handles the traffic spike from that Product Hunt launch — no 3 AM alerts"

Every feature line should follow this structure: `[Feature Name] — [What it means for the visitor]`

Keep the feature section to five or six items maximum. More than that and visitors stop reading. If you have a product with thirty features, pick the five that solve the most painful problems for your target customer. The rest go in your docs.

Group features if you have to. Three groups of three is easier to scan than nine individual items. Use short labels — three to five words — then one supporting sentence.

A note on specificity: numbers win. "Saves time" is weak. "Saves an average of 4.3 hours per week" is concrete. If you do not have data yet, get it by asking your existing users. Even three responses that say "about four hours" gives you a number to use.

## Social Proof: The Right Evidence at the Right Moment

Visitors arrive skeptical. Social proof converts skeptics. But not all social proof works equally well.

**What works:**
- Testimonials that describe a before/after ("Before GitDeploy, I spent 45 minutes per deploy. Now it is two minutes.")
- Specific outcomes ("Used this to go from 0 to 200 paying customers in 90 days")
- Logos from companies your target customer respects
- Usage numbers ("14,000 developers use GitDeploy every week")

**What does not work:**
- "Great product!" — no context, no specificity, no believability
- Stock photo testimonials — everyone knows they are fake
- Logos from companies no one has heard of, listed without context

Place social proof in two spots: immediately below the hero (to catch the skeptics early) and just above your final CTA (to convert the ones who almost signed up but needed one more push).

If you are early-stage and have no testimonials yet, ask your beta users directly: "What would you tell a friend about this product?" One sentence from three real users beats a fake wall of five-star reviews.

## Putting It All Together: A Before/After Example

Here is a real transformation. Before — a typical developer-written hero:

**Headline**: "ProjectFlow — AI-Powered Project Management"

**Subheadline**: "ProjectFlow uses machine learning to optimize your team's workflow with intelligent task assignment, automated status updates, and real-time reporting dashboards."

This tells you what it is and how it works. It does not tell you why you should care.

After, applying the framework:

**Headline**: "Ship Projects on Time Without the Spreadsheet Chaos"

**Subheadline**: "ProjectFlow handles status updates, deadline tracking, and blockers automatically — so your team spends time building, not reporting."

Same product. Completely different angle. The first version is a feature list. The second version is a promise. Visitors who have ever suffered through spreadsheet project tracking will feel that second version immediately.

The [DRM 101 guide](/drm-101) has a full breakdown of how landing page copy fits into your sales pipeline — including how to sequence your traffic, email capture, and offer so that your landing page is not doing all the work alone.

## FAQ: SaaS Landing Page Copywriting

**How long should a SaaS landing page be?**

Long enough to answer every objection, short enough that visitors do not bounce before reaching your CTA. For most early-stage SaaS products, that means five to seven sections: hero, problem, features, social proof, and CTA. That typically runs 400–800 words on screen. If you have a complex product with a long sales cycle, longer pages often convert better because visitors need more reassurance. Test both. The only correct answer is the one with the higher conversion rate.

**What should the hero headline say?**

The headline should name the outcome your customer wants, or the pain they want to escape — ideally both. It should not describe your product category, your tech stack, or your feature set. A useful test: read your headline out loud and ask "so what?" If you can answer that question in a way that explains the value, your headline is too vague. Keep rewriting until the headline itself answers "so what" for the visitor.

**Should I explain how my product works on the landing page?**

Brief mention — yes. Deep explanation — no. Visitors buy outcomes, not mechanisms. A one-sentence explanation of the approach (e.g., "GitDeploy connects to your repo and auto-configures your server on every push") is enough to establish plausibility. Save the full technical breakdown for your docs, your onboarding flow, or a dedicated "how it works" page. If you find yourself writing three paragraphs about your architecture on the landing page, cut it to two sentences and link to a deeper explainer.

**How do I write landing page copy when I have no customers yet?**

Talk to five people in your target audience before you write a word. Ask them: "What is the most frustrating part of [the problem you solve]?" and "What have you tried that did not work?" Write their exact words down. Your landing page copy is already in those answers. The best copy sounds like the customer wrote it — because in a sense, they did. You are just organizing their language into a persuasive structure.

## Stop Writing READMEs. Start Writing Landing Pages.

You now have everything you need: the mental model (one job), the section structure (hero, problem, features, social proof, CTA), fill-in-the-blank templates, and a before/after example showing exactly how the transformation works.

The only thing left is to actually write it. Open a text editor, paste the template, and fill in your specifics. Do not wait until it is perfect. A mediocre landing page that is live beats a perfect landing page still sitting in a Notion doc.

Once your copy is drafted, run it through the [SaaS landing page playbook](/playbooks/saas-landing-page) — it covers the full page structure including layout decisions, above-the-fold optimization, and what to A/B test first.

SaaS landing page copywriting is a skill. Like any skill, you are bad at it the first time and better every iteration after that. Ship the page. Read the heatmaps. Rewrite the headline. Repeat.

Your README is not going to sell your product. Your landing page will.
