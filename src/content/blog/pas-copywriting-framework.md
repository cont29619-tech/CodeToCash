If you could only learn one copywriting framework and use it for everything — your landing page, your emails, your Twitter threads, your product descriptions — the PAS copywriting framework would be the one to pick. Problem. Agitate. Solution. Three steps. Endlessly repeatable. Ruthlessly effective.

Most developers dismiss copywriting as soft, subjective, creative work. PAS proves it isn't. It's a formula. You identify the specific problem your reader has. You make them feel the cost of that problem as viscerally as possible. Then you position your product as the obvious fix. No creativity required. No wordsmithing. Just pattern-matching and specificity.

Here's the deep dive.

## Why PAS Works So Well

The PAS framework works because it maps exactly onto how buying decisions are made. People don't buy products — they buy solutions to problems they feel urgently. The framework exploits this psychology in three precise steps.

**Step 1 — Problem:** You prove you understand the reader's situation better than they do. This creates instant rapport. When someone reads a problem statement and thinks "how did they know that's exactly what I'm dealing with?" — you have their full attention.

**Step 2 — Agitate:** Most developers skip this step and jump straight to the solution. That's a mistake. Agitation is where the copy does its heaviest lifting. You're not making the problem worse — you're making the reader *feel* the problem. You're connecting the surface-level frustration to the deeper consequences they're afraid of. The business implications. The time cost. The opportunity cost. The emotional toll. This is what creates urgency.

**Step 3 — Solution:** After the reader is fully feeling the problem and its consequences, your product appears as relief. Not a feature list — relief. The solution step isn't "here's everything our product does." It's "here's exactly how this makes the pain stop." The reader is primed. They want the fix. You provide it cleanly.

Think of it in engineering terms. Problem is the bug report. Agitate is the severity assessment and business-impact analysis. Solution is the patch. The patch only gets deployed after the team understands how bad the bug actually is.

## The Step Most Developers Skip: Agitate

Let's spend more time here because it's where most developer copy falls apart.

Developers are problem-solvers. By instinct, the moment you identify a problem, you jump to the fix. Problem → Solution. Skip the middle. But in copy, skipping agitation means skipping urgency — and without urgency, the reader has no reason to act today.

Here's the difference in practice:

**Without agitation (weak):**
```
PROBLEM:  "Deploying your app is complicated."
SOLUTION: "DeployKit makes deployment simple."
```

**With agitation (strong):**
```
PROBLEM:  "Deploying your app is complicated."

AGITATE:  "You've spent three Sundays debugging CI/CD pipelines
           instead of shipping features. Your competitor pushed
           six updates this week while you were reading DigitalOcean
           docs at midnight. Every hour you waste on DevOps is an
           hour you're not building the thing users actually pay for.
           And the worst part? You know this. You just haven't found
           a way out."

SOLUTION: "DeployKit makes deployment simple."
```

Same problem. Same solution. Completely different emotional impact. The agitated version makes the reader feel the full weight of their current situation. By the time the solution appears, it's not just interesting — it's necessary.

The best agitation touches three layers:

1. **Time cost** — how much of their life this problem consumes
2. **Opportunity cost** — what they're missing while stuck in the problem
3. **Emotional cost** — the frustration, doubt, or fear it creates

Hit all three and your reader is ready to buy before you've even mentioned your product name.

## 3 Full Worked Examples

Here's PAS applied to three different developer products:

### Example 1: A Deployment Tool

```
PROBLEM:  "Your deployment process is a 47-step manual checklist
           you wrote in a Notion doc two years ago. Half of it is
           outdated. Nobody else on the team knows the full process."

AGITATE:  "Which means every deployment is a gamble. You hold your
           breath and hope you didn't miss the step about flushing
           the Redis cache. When something breaks at 2 AM, it's you
           who gets paged — because you're the only one who knows
           the process. You can't take a vacation. You can't hand
           it off. You're the single point of failure in your own
           system, and it's exhausting."

SOLUTION: "DeployKit turns your deployment process into a versioned,
           automated pipeline anyone on the team can run. Define it
           once in a YAML file, run it with one command. No more
           checklist. No more 2 AM pages. No more being the
           indispensable, exhausted deployment wizard."
```

### Example 2: A SaaS Boilerplate

```
PROBLEM:  "You want to build a SaaS, but three weeks in you're
           still scaffolding and haven't touched your actual idea."

AGITATE:  "You're building auth. Again. You're wiring up Stripe.
           Again. You're setting up the user dashboard, the
           settings page, the billing portal — all things that have
           nothing to do with what makes your product unique.
           Meanwhile someone else shipped a competing product last
           Thursday. You're still configuring next-auth.
           The window doesn't stay open forever."

SOLUTION: "LaunchBase is a Next.js SaaS boilerplate with auth,
           payments, teams, and email all pre-built and production-
           tested. Clone the repo, configure your environment
           variables, and you're writing actual product code on
           day one. Stop rebuilding the foundation. Start building
           your product."
```

### Example 3: A Developer Course

```
PROBLEM:  "You've been 'learning system design' for eight months
           and you still don't feel ready for senior-level
           interviews."

AGITATE:  "You've watched three YouTube series, read Designing
           Data-Intensive Applications twice, and done 150 LeetCode
           problems. But when you sit in a mock interview and someone
           asks you to design Twitter, your mind goes blank. You're
           not learning — you're consuming. And every month you spend
           consuming instead of interviewing is another month at a
           salary $50K below what you're worth."

SOLUTION: "The System Design Interview Playbook gives you a
           repeatable framework for any system design question,
           30 walkthrough videos, and weekly live practice sessions
           with senior engineers. Stop consuming. Start performing.
           Your next salary negotiation depends on it."
```

## The PAS Fill-in-the-Blank Template

Copy this directly. Swap in your product's specifics:

```
PAS TEMPLATE
════════════

PROBLEM:
"[Your audience] struggles with [specific painful situation].
 [Name the exact moment the problem appears — the trigger event]."

AGITATE:
"Which means [consequence 1 — time or money cost].
 Meanwhile [opportunity cost — what they're missing out on].
 And underneath all of it: [the emotional cost — the fear,
 doubt, or frustration they feel but don't say out loud].
 [Optional: the thing they've already tried that didn't work]."

SOLUTION:
"[Your product] [specific mechanism that fixes the problem].
 [Specific result, ideally with a timeframe].
 [What life looks like after — the relief, not the feature]."

CTA:
"[One clear action] — [remove the biggest barrier to starting]."
```

## PAS vs. AIDA: When to Use Each

The two most common DRM copywriting frameworks are PAS and AIDA (Attention → Interest → Desire → Action). They're complementary, not competing. Here's how to decide:

**Use PAS when:**
- Writing short-form copy: email subject lines, tweets, ad headlines, landing page sections
- The pain point is the strongest angle (tools that solve obvious, felt problems)
- You need to move fast — PAS is tighter and quicker to write
- Your audience is pain-aware (they know they have the problem, they don't have the fix)

**Use AIDA when:**
- Writing longer copy: full landing pages, long-form emails, sales pages
- The product category is new (readers need more education before they're ready to buy)
- You're writing to a cold audience that doesn't yet recognize the problem
- You want to take someone from completely cold to fully convinced in one piece

In practice, you'll often use both in the same piece: PAS for the hero section (fast, sharp hook), AIDA for the full page body (slower, more educational). For a complete breakdown of both frameworks with fill-in-the-blank templates, read our guide on [copywriting frameworks for developers](/blog/copywriting-frameworks-for-developers).

## The Specificity Rule: Make It Visceral

The most common mistake developers make with PAS is vagueness in the Problem step. Compare these:

**Vague (weak):** "Marketing is hard for developers."

**Specific (strong):** "You shipped last Tuesday. You posted on Twitter, got 18 likes from other developers, and then silence. Your analytics show 94 unique visitors in the first week and zero sign-ups."

The specific version makes the reader feel recognized. "That's exactly what happened to me." Vague copy produces vague results. Specific copy produces specific conversions.

To write specific problems, mine your own experience. What were you doing the exact moment you felt the pain this product solves? What did the situation actually look like? What was the number on the screen? What were you trying to do that wasn't working? That level of granular, situational specificity is what makes PAS land.

A useful test: if someone who doesn't have this problem could read your Problem step and think it applies to them, it's too vague. The right level of specificity makes unaffected readers think "this isn't about me" — and affected readers think "this person is reading my mind."

## Start Writing With PAS Today

The PAS copywriting framework is the highest-leverage tool in a developer's marketing toolkit. Fast to write, effective across every channel, and most powerful in the Agitate step — the one everyone else skips.

Here's your next action:

1. **Write your Problem statement.** One to three sentences. Make it specific. Name the trigger moment.
2. **Write your Agitation.** Three to five sentences. Cover the time cost, opportunity cost, and emotional cost.
3. **Write your Solution.** Two to three sentences. Lead with relief, not features.

Do this for your hero headline, your email subject lines, and your first email in your welcome sequence. You'll have better copy for three channels in under an hour.
