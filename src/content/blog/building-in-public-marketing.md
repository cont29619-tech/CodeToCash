faq:
  - question: "What does building in public mean?"
    answer: "Building in public means sharing your product development journey openly — posting revenue numbers, sharing what's working and what isn't, documenting your mistakes and breakthroughs, and narrating your decisions in real time, typically on Twitter/X or a blog. It's a marketing strategy because transparency builds trust, creates a narrative people want to follow, and turns your process into content that attracts your target audience."
  - question: "Does building in public actually help with sales?"
    answer: "Yes — when done consistently and with genuine transparency. Developers who build in public typically launch to an engaged audience of hundreds or thousands of followers who have watched the product be built and feel invested in its success. This creates a built-in launch audience that converts at far higher rates than cold traffic from ads or cold outreach."
  - question: "What should I share when building in public?"
    answer: "The most engaging content is honest and specific: real revenue numbers (even if small or zero), specific challenges you're facing and how you solved them, decisions you made and why, metrics that show trajectory, and lessons learned from failures. Avoid generic motivation content or vague progress updates — your audience wants the numbers and the details."
  - question: "Is building in public risky — will competitors copy my idea?"
    answer: "The risk of a competitor stealing your idea is vastly overstated. Execution, distribution, and customer relationships are your real competitive advantages — not the idea itself. Meanwhile, the benefits of building in public (audience building, accountability, inbound opportunities, early customer discovery) are concrete and significant. The risk-reward calculation strongly favors transparency for indie developers."
  - question: "How long does it take for building in public to generate meaningful traffic or sales?"
    answer: "Most developers who build in public consistently for 3-6 months see meaningful audience growth and inbound interest. The compounding nature of content means early posts continue to attract followers over time. The developers who give up after 2-3 posts never experience the compounding — consistency over at least 90 days is the minimum viable commitment."

Most developers build in private. Six months of work, hundreds of commits, a landing page built at 1 AM the week before launch, and a tweet that says "excited to finally share what I've been working on." The launch gets 200 views from friends and other developers. Then silence. [Building without an audience is the most common reason developer products fail to get customers](/blog/why-developer-products-fail-marketing) — and it's entirely avoidable.

The build in public marketing strategy inverts this entirely. Instead of building in private and launching to silence, you build in public and launch to an audience that has been rooting for you for months. Your journey is the content. Your progress is the marketing. Your failures and pivots are the story people come back for.

Pieter Levels (Nomad List, Remote OK) built a following of hundreds of thousands of developers by sharing every metric, every revenue milestone, and every setback in public. He did not have a marketing budget. He had transparency. [His products now generate millions per year](https://x.com/levelsio) — and his audience is the primary reason.

You do not need his scale. You need his approach.

## What "Building in Public" Actually Means

Building in public is not posting screenshots of your code and calling it marketing. Done well, it is a systematic approach to audience building that happens in parallel with product development — so by the time you launch, you have an audience of people who already know what you built, why you built it, and whether it solves their problem.

The core principle: **your process is interesting to the people who have the problem you are solving.** A developer building a deployment tool is not interesting to other developers who build deployment tools. They are interesting to developers who struggle with deployment and desperately want a solution. Your journey — the problems you hit, the architecture decisions you made, the frustrating bugs you debugged at midnight — is exactly the content that developer needs to trust you as someone who understands their problem.

Building in public is also a customer discovery mechanism. When you share what you are building and someone replies "I need this RIGHT NOW, how do I get access?" — that is a qualified lead. When someone says "this is interesting but I would actually need it to do X" — that is product feedback that improves your product before you ship it. The audience builds the product as much as the product builds the audience.

## What to Share (And What Not To)

The most common mistake: sharing what you think is interesting rather than what your audience finds valuable. Here is the breakdown:

**High-performing content for building in public:**

- **Revenue milestones** — "I hit $500 MRR this week." Numbers get shared. Numbers are concrete. Numbers make other developers believe that what you are doing is possible.
- **Specific failures with lessons** — "I spent three days on a feature nobody wanted. Here's the signal I missed that I'll catch next time." Failures are more relatable than wins. Lessons turn failures into value.
- **Behind-the-scenes process** — "Here's the exact algorithm I use to prioritize what to build next." Developers love process content. It is educational and builds authority.
- **Before/after metrics** — "Before: 12 visitors/day. After changing the headline: 89 visitors/day. The only thing I changed:" Specific improvements with specific numbers consistently outperform vague success posts.
- **Honest product comparisons** — "Here's how my tool compares to [competitor]. Here's where it wins. Here's where it loses. Here's why I think that's the right tradeoff for my audience." Intellectual honesty builds trust faster than marketing polish.

**Low-performing content:**

- "Excited to be working on something new!" — vague, no signal, no value
- Feature announcements without context — "Added dark mode" — nobody cares unless you explain why it mattered to customers
- Pure promotional posts — "Check out my product" — no context, no story, no value exchange
- Generic hot takes on developer tools — indistinguishable from thousands of other developers posting the same opinions

The test for any piece of content: would a developer who has the problem you are solving find this genuinely useful, interesting, or validating? If not, it is not building in public — it is noise.

## The Posting Cadence: Daily, Weekly, Monthly

The developers who build the largest audiences through building in public post consistently across three time horizons:

**Daily micro-updates (1–3 sentences):** What did you build or learn today? This is the raw material — a single observation, a small win, a question you are wrestling with. Keep it under 280 characters. These posts compound over time and establish you as someone who ships consistently.

Example: "Rewrote the API key management system. Old version had a subtle race condition in concurrent requests. New version is 40% faster. Small fix, big relief."

**Weekly progress reports (200–400 words):** A structured update covering three things — what you shipped, one metric that moved, and one thing you learned. The weekly report is where you build depth. It gives followers a reason to check in on you. Publish it every Sunday or Monday morning. Consistency is more important than day of week.

**Monthly retrospectives (500–800 words):** Full reflection on the month. Revenue, users, biggest win, biggest miss, what you are prioritizing next month. This is the content that gets bookmarked, shared, and referenced. Monthly retros are the cornerstone of a serious build-in-public strategy. They attract new followers who discover you through the retrospective and then binge your previous ones.

Start with just the weekly report if the cadence feels overwhelming. Consistency at a sustainable frequency beats sporadic intensity.

## Starting From Zero Followers

The most common objection to building in public: "Nobody is following me. I am talking to nobody."

You are right, at first. Here is how to bootstrap.

**The reply-first strategy.** Before expecting engagement on your own posts, spend 20 minutes a day engaging with other people in your target community. Reply with genuine, substantive thoughts — not "great post!" but an actual observation, a counterpoint, or a question that extends the conversation. Do this consistently for 30 days on the accounts your target customers follow. You will pick up followers who are pre-qualified: they are interested in the same problems you are solving.

**Tag the tools you use.** When you post about your build, mention the tools in your stack. "Building this auth system with @nextjsofficial + @prisma + @clerkhq — deployed on @vercel. Here's the architecture:" — each mention extends your reach to that tool's followers, many of whom are exactly your target customer.

**Ask questions, not just statements.** "How do you handle rate limiting in your SaaS?" gets more replies than "Here's how I handle rate limiting." Both build authority. But questions build community, and community builds audience faster than broadcasting.

**Post in communities, not just on your profile.** Indie Hackers, r/SaaS, relevant Discord servers — share your weekly updates in communities where your target customers are active. Link back to your profile. Community posts often outperform profile posts for discoverability when you have fewer than 500 followers.

## Converting Followers to Customers: The Email List Is the Real Asset

Here is the critical insight most developers miss: social media followers are borrowed. Twitter/X can change its algorithm, restrict reach, or suspend your account. Your followers there are on Twitter's platform. Your email list is yours.

The build in public strategy should be designed to funnel social audience into email subscribers from the beginning. Here is how:

**Your lead magnet is the natural next step from your content.** If you post weekly about deployment processes, your lead magnet is a deployment checklist. If you post about SaaS growth, your lead magnet is a SaaS metrics spreadsheet template. The lead magnet should feel like the obvious companion to your public content.

**Mention your newsletter in your content.** Not every post. But at the end of your monthly retrospective, your most popular weekly update, or your most shared post: "If you want the full breakdown including the metrics I don't post publicly, it goes to my newsletter first. Link in bio."

**The beta access approach.** When you are approaching launch, offer your followers early access via your email list. "I'm opening 50 beta spots next week. Getting on the list means you get first access and founding member pricing." This converts followers to email subscribers in a natural, value-aligned way — they get something real in exchange.

**The soft launch to your list.** Before you publicly launch, send your email list a "soft launch" email — a full explanation of what you built, why, who it is for, and a link to try it. Ask them to share feedback. Ask them to share the product if it solves a problem they have seen others struggle with. Your email list is your most engaged audience. The soft launch converts more than any Product Hunt post.

## The Weekly Build-in-Public Template

Here is the template that works. Copy it, customize the numbers, post every week.

```
WEEKLY BUILD-IN-PUBLIC UPDATE TEMPLATE
═══════════════════════════════════════

HOOK (one line — your biggest number or most interesting moment):
"[PRODUCT] week [#]: [SPECIFIC ACHIEVEMENT OR INTERESTING OBSERVATION]"

Example: "AuthKit week 12: First customer who found us organically from Google."

WHAT I SHIPPED:
"This week I shipped [SPECIFIC FEATURE/IMPROVEMENT].
[One sentence: why this mattered — the customer problem it solved]."

THE NUMBER:
"[METRIC] this week: [NUMBER] ([↑/↓] from last week)
[One sentence context: what caused the change or what I learned]"

Key metrics to rotate through:
  - Weekly active users
  - New signups
  - MRR / revenue
  - Landing page conversion rate
  - Email open rate
  - Churn this month

ONE LESSON:
"Learned this week: [SPECIFIC INSIGHT]
[2–3 sentences expanding on why this matters or how you'll apply it]"

Example: "Learned this week: our most common support question is also our worst
onboarding step. We answer the question in email, but never show the answer
in the product. Next week I'm fixing the product, not the email."

QUESTION FOR YOUR AUDIENCE:
"Question for anyone building [IN YOUR SPACE]:
[SPECIFIC QUESTION THAT INVITES RESPONSES]"

Example: "Question for anyone building dev tools: how do you handle
pricing for teams? We're seeing enterprise customers ask about per-seat
pricing but we built flat-rate. Curious what others have done."

CTA (optional, max once per 3–4 posts):
"If this resonates, [PRODUCT] is [WHAT IT IS + LINK]."
```

Post this every Sunday or Monday. Within 90 days of consistent weekly updates, you will have an archive of 12+ progress posts that tell the story of your product, attract followers who are following along, and establish you as someone who ships consistently. That credibility is what converts a follower into a customer when launch day arrives.

## FAQ: Build in Public Marketing Strategy

**What if I don't have anything impressive to share yet?**

Share the unimpressive things. That is the point. "I spent four hours debugging a timezone issue and the fix was one line" is a relatable, honest post that attracts developers who have lived through exactly that experience. The developers with the largest build-in-public audiences did not start with impressive numbers. They started with honest, specific posts about ordinary developer experiences. The impressive numbers came later — and they already had an audience to share them with.

**Should I share revenue numbers publicly?**

If you are comfortable with it: yes, consistently. Revenue transparency is one of the highest-engagement content formats in the indie developer community. Developers want to know if building and selling products is actually viable. Real revenue numbers answer that question. They also create accountability — once you have shared a revenue milestone publicly, you have social pressure to keep building and sharing. If you are not comfortable sharing exact revenue, share growth percentages or milestone achievements ("hit my first $1K month") instead.

**How do I build in public if I am shy or introverted?**

You do not have to appear on camera or give talks. Build in public is writing-first — posts, threads, update emails, retrospective blog posts. Many of the most followed builders post exclusively in text. Start with just the weekly update template above. Write it, post it, close Twitter. You are not required to engage with every comment or be "on" as a personality. The consistency of the posts builds the audience. The human presence comes through the writing, not through performance.

## Your Build Is Already Happening. Now Make It Public.

The build in public marketing strategy does not require you to start a new project or change what you are building. It requires you to narrate the project you are already building. The work is happening. The question is whether anyone is watching.

Every week you build in private is a week of audience-building you cannot get back. Every milestone you hit without sharing it is a missed opportunity to attract the exact customers who would pay for what you are building.

You do not need a perfect launch. You need an audience who is ready for it.

Start this Sunday. Write a one-paragraph update about where you are on your current project — what you shipped this week, one number, one lesson. Post it. See what happens.

For more on how to integrate building in public with the rest of your marketing system — email, landing pages, and paid traffic — read [How to Sell Software Built with AI](/blog/sell-software-built-with-ai) and the [DRM 101 guide](/drm-101). They give you the full picture: build in public is the top of funnel, and everything else converts that audience into revenue.

Your build is already happening. The only question is whether anyone is watching.
