faq:
  - question: "Is it ethical to sell software built with AI tools?"
    answer: "Yes — the value of software is in the problem it solves, not the tools used to write it. Customers pay for outcomes, not for your personal coding effort. Disclosing that you used AI tools is a matter of personal choice, not legal obligation in most contexts. What matters ethically is that your product does what you claim and delivers the value you promise."
  - question: "Do I need to disclose that my product was built with AI?"
    answer: "There is currently no general legal requirement to disclose AI use in software development in most jurisdictions. Many successful indie developers are transparent about using tools like Cursor or Claude as a selling point — it signals technical savvy and efficient execution. Whether to disclose is a business and personal ethics decision rather than a legal one."
  - question: "How do I compete when anyone can build a similar product with AI?"
    answer: "Distribution, brand, and customer trust are your moats — not the code itself. When building barriers are low for everyone, the winner is the person who markets best, builds an audience first, gets to customers first, and earns their loyalty. This is exactly why learning direct response marketing is more valuable now than it's ever been for developers."
  - question: "What is the fastest way to validate a vibe-coded product before investing in marketing?"
    answer: "Before building a landing page or running ads, find 10 people who fit your target customer profile and ask if they'd pay for what you're describing. If you can get 3 people to say 'yes, I'd pay $X for that' before you've written a line of code or a word of copy, you have enough validation to invest in marketing. This conversation costs nothing and filters out ideas that won't sell."
  - question: "What marketing channel works best for AI-built SaaS products?"
    answer: "The developer and indie hacker community on Twitter/X and Hacker News has a uniquely positive response to founders who build transparently with AI tools — it's a differentiator, not a liability, in that audience. Product Hunt also has a strong appetite for AI-built tools. Start with the organic channels where your transparency about the build process is itself a marketing asset."

The internet is full of products built with Claude, Cursor, and Windsurf that work perfectly and sold nothing. Not because the products are bad. Because the developers who built them never learned how to sell software built with AI — or anything else.

Vibe coding has compressed the time from idea to working product from months to days. What used to require a team of three for six weeks now takes one developer and a weekend. The result: thousands of new products shipping every month, the vast majority of which will earn $0 in their first 90 days. Not because of AI code quality. Because of marketing.

The graveyard of AI-built products is not full of bad software. It is full of good software that never reached the people who needed it.

This guide is the other half of the vibe coder's skill stack. Building fast is not enough. You need to sell fast too.

## The Vibe Coder's Marketing Paradox

Here is the problem in one sentence: AI made building 10x faster, but it did not make selling 10x faster. The bottleneck has shifted entirely.

In 2020, the bottleneck for an indie developer was engineering velocity. Could you build a working product fast enough before running out of runway? AI largely solved that. In 2026, most vibe coders can ship a production-ready SaaS in a weekend. The bottleneck is now distribution, positioning, and trust.

This creates a new kind of developer. They ship constantly — a new product every few weeks — and each one gets a Product Hunt post, a tweet, maybe a Hacker News comment. Most get 50–200 visitors and then nothing. The developer assumes the market does not want this product. They move to the next idea. Repeat.

The actual problem: they never built a marketing system. Every product launch started from zero — no audience, no email list, no positioning, no follow-up. They were building new products faster than they were learning to sell any of them.

The fix is not to build less. It is to build a marketing system once and apply it to every product you ship. For the foundational principles behind that system, the [DRM 101 guide](/drm-101) is the complete reference.

## Do Not Hide the AI: It Is a Feature, Not a Liability

A common instinct when selling software built with AI is to obscure the development process. "AI-assisted" sounds cheaper. Customers might think the product is lower quality. So developers say nothing about how they built it.

This is the wrong call in 2026, for three reasons.

**Transparency builds trust.** Customers who know you built fast and iterated quickly understand why the product is affordable and why features ship fast. Hiding your process creates an expectation gap. Revealing it creates alignment.

**Your build speed is a feature.** A developer who can ship a feature request in 48 hours because they use AI-assisted development is more valuable than a developer who takes three weeks. Customers benefit from your efficiency. Selling this as a capability ("I iterate quickly based on feedback") is a competitive advantage, not a liability.

**The stigma is fading fast.** The developers who are embarrassed about building with AI are the exception in 2026, not the rule. Most customers care about the outcome — does the software solve their problem reliably? If it does, how you built it is irrelevant to them.

What you should not do: ship buggy, half-tested software and use "it's AI-generated code" as an excuse. The bar for quality has not changed. Only the tools have.

## Nail the Message Before You Promote

This is where most vibe coders waste the most time. They jump straight to promotion — tweeting, posting on Product Hunt, submitting to directories — before they have a clear answer to the most basic marketing question: *who is this for and what specific problem does it solve for them?*

Vague positioning produces vague results. "A tool for productivity" attracts nobody. "The fastest way for solo developers to build client-facing dashboards without writing a line of CSS" attracts exactly the right people.

Before you write a single tweet or set up a paid ad, write out the answers to these three questions:

**1. Who is the specific person this is for?** Not "developers." Which developers? What stage of their career? What size company? What specific tech stack or workflow? The more specific, the better. "Senior Rails developers at B2B SaaS companies who are bottlenecked on frontend work" is a target audience. "Developers" is a category.

**2. What is the exact problem it solves?** Not "saves time." What specific task were they doing before that was painful? What was the last thing they typed into Google before finding your product? "Setting up role-based access control in a Next.js app takes three days every time I start a new project" is a problem. "Authentication is complicated" is not.

**3. What is the specific result they get?** Not "increases productivity." A measurable, time-bound outcome. "Set up production-ready RBAC in 45 minutes on any Next.js project" is a result. "More productive" is not.

Fill in this template and you have your positioning:

```
POSITIONING STATEMENT TEMPLATE
═══════════════════════════════

For [SPECIFIC PERSON]
who struggle with [SPECIFIC PAINFUL TASK],
[PRODUCT NAME] is the [CATEGORY]
that [SPECIFIC MECHANISM / HOW IT WORKS AT A HIGH LEVEL]
so they can [SPECIFIC RESULT IN MEASURABLE TERMS]
without [BIGGEST FEAR OR OBJECTION].

Example:
"For solo Rails developers
who spend days implementing auth from scratch on every new project,
AuthKit is the drop-in authentication library
that handles OAuth, MFA, and session management via a single gem install
so they can have production-ready auth in under an hour
without writing a single line of auth logic."
```

Once this is written, every piece of marketing — your landing page headline, your tweet, your Product Hunt tagline — comes from this single statement. Consistency in positioning is what makes marketing accumulate rather than scatter.

For more on how to apply this to your entire funnel, read [Marketing for Vibe Coders](/blog/marketing-for-vibe-coders) — it covers the three fundamentals every fast-shipping developer needs before promoting anything.

## The Minimum Viable Launch Stack

You do not need a complex marketing setup to sell software built with AI. You need four things, and you can build all of them in a day.

**1. A landing page with an outcome headline.** One page. One message. The headline states the result from the positioning statement. Below it: three problem points (so they feel understood), your core features framed as benefits, and one email capture CTA with a lead magnet (checklist, template, or demo access). That is the whole page. Do not overthink it. A live page converting at 3% beats a perfect page still in Notion.

**2. An email tool with a welcome sequence.** ConvertKit's free tier handles everything you need up to 1,000 subscribers. Set up a 5-email welcome sequence before your first subscriber arrives. Email 1 delivers the lead magnet. Email 2 tells your origin story. Email 3 delivers a quick win. Email 4 handles the top objection. Email 5 makes the direct offer with a CTA. Five emails is enough to go from "stranger who gave me an email" to "customer."

**3. A tweet thread for launch day.** Three tweets, structured as follows:

```
LAUNCH TWEET THREAD TEMPLATE
══════════════════════════════

TWEET 1 — THE HOOK (grab attention with the specific outcome)
"I got tired of [SPECIFIC PAINFUL PROBLEM].

So I built [PRODUCT NAME] — [ONE SENTENCE OUTCOME].

[NUMBER] developers are already using it.
Here's what it does: 🧵"

TWEET 2 — THE STORY + SPECIFICS (the what and the how)
"[PRODUCT NAME] solves [SPECIFIC PROBLEM] by [HOW IT WORKS].

Before: [PAINFUL STATUS QUO — be specific, use a scenario]

After: [SPECIFIC RESULT — use a number, timeframe, or comparison]

Built in [X days/weeks] with [your stack].
Shipped it before I talked myself out of it."

TWEET 3 — THE CTA (the soft ask)
"[PRODUCT NAME] is live now.

[SPECIFIC OFFER]: [FREE TRIAL / ONE-TIME PRICE / FREEMIUM]

[Link to landing page]

If this is useful, RT to share it with a developer who would benefit.
I read every reply."
```

**4. One community post.** Pick the single most relevant community for your target customer: r/SaaS, r/webdev, a Discord server, Indie Hackers, or Hacker News Show HN. Write a genuine post that leads with the problem and your process, not the product. The community gets value from the process story. The product link is secondary.

That is the entire minimum viable launch stack. Most vibe coders over-engineer the marketing setup. Four things, executed well, will outperform twelve things executed poorly.

## Where to Find Early Customers for AI-Built Tools

Traffic does not appear automatically. Here are the channels that work for developers selling to developers:

**Indie Hackers** — Post a milestone update ("I hit $500 MRR in my first month") with your story. Indie Hackers celebrates revenue milestones. The audience is full of builders who are also potential customers or referrers.

**Hacker News Show HN** — Post "Show HN: [Product] — [one-sentence description]". HN readers are technical, critical, and honest. A good Show HN can drive thousands of visitors in 24 hours. A poor one teaches you what is wrong with your positioning faster than any A/B test.

**Product Hunt** — Best for reaching early adopters and getting initial reviews. Schedule your launch for a Tuesday or Wednesday. Prepare your product page the night before. Have 20+ supporters ready to comment and upvote at launch (ask your beta users and Twitter followers).

**Twitter/X building in public** — Document your build journey before launch. The developers who generate the most interest on launch day are the ones who have been sharing progress for weeks. Your launch is the payoff for an audience that has been rooting for you. Without the journey, the launch is just a cold advertisement.

**Niche Discord servers** — Find the Discord servers where your exact target customer hangs out. Become a helpful member before you promote anything. Then, when the moment is right — when someone asks a question your product directly answers — mention it genuinely. One authentic mention in a 500-person Discord can convert better than 10,000 Twitter impressions.

## When Your AI-Built Product Is Not Selling

If you have launched and the product is not getting traction, the cause is almost always one of three things:

**Wrong audience targeting.** You are promoting to developers, but the buyers are actually startup founders who are not technical. Or you are posting in communities where everyone could build your product themselves, so they see no need to pay for it. Revisit your positioning. Who actually has this problem and cannot solve it themselves?

**Features listed instead of outcomes.** Your landing page or your tweets describe what the product does rather than what the customer gets. "Built with GPT-4" is a feature. "Write a week of social content in 15 minutes" is an outcome. Rewrite everything through the lens of the result the customer cares about.

**No follow-up system.** You got 200 visitors on launch day, 12 people signed up, you sent them a welcome email, and then nothing. The 11 who did not immediately convert are gone forever — you have no sequence warming them up, no weekly email maintaining the relationship, no retargeting. Set up the 5-email welcome sequence and a weekly newsletter. Most conversions happen between the third and seventh touchpoint.

## FAQ: Selling Software Built with AI

**Does it matter that I built it with AI?**

To most customers: no. They care whether it solves their problem reliably and whether you will be there to support it. To a small segment of technically sophisticated customers: they might ask about code quality or maintenance. Have an honest answer ready — you review and test the output, the product is production-tested, and you are actively maintaining it. That is all they need to hear.

**How do I compete with products built by larger teams?**

Speed and focus. A team of ten cannot pivot as fast as you can. They cannot add a niche integration in 48 hours based on a single customer request. They cannot talk to every customer personally. Your advantages are responsiveness, personalization, and a laser focus on one narrow problem that a larger product treats as a minor feature. Own your niche instead of competing head-to-head on feature count.

**What is the fastest way to get my first paying customer?**

Talk to 20 people in your target audience before you invest in a landing page or promotion. Tell them what you built. Ask if they have the problem it solves. If they say yes, ask if they want to pay for beta access. Charge something — even $10 — to validate that they would actually pay, not just that they said "yes" to avoid being rude. Your first customer almost always comes from your network or a direct conversation, not from a cold landing page.

## Your Build Is Good Enough. Now Sell It.

The developers who turn their AI-built products into revenue are not building better products than the ones who do not. They are building marketing systems alongside the products. They have positioning before they promote. They have a landing page before they tweet. They have an email sequence before they get subscribers.

You have the building part. Now build the selling part.

Start with the positioning statement template in this post. Run it past two people in your target audience and ask if it describes them. Then build the minimum viable launch stack — landing page, email sequence, launch thread, community post. That is a weekend of work.

The [Building in Public Playbook](/playbooks/building-in-public) gives you a week-by-week system for turning your build journey into an audience of future customers before you ever hit launch day. And the [DRM 101 guide](/drm-101) maps the complete sales system from traffic to retention so you can see exactly where your product fits in and where the gaps are.

The graveyard of AI-built products is full of good ideas that never reached the right people. Your idea does not have to end there.

Build the system. Ship the product. Sell it.
